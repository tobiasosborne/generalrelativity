[00:00.40] hello and welcome back to introduction
[00:01.92] to general relativity
[00:03.52] today we're going to exploit all the
[00:05.60] hard work that we've invested
[00:07.04] in learning the mathematics of
[00:08.40] differential geometry to finally
[00:10.72] discuss general relativity
[00:14.24] before we get to the full formulation of
[00:16.80] einstein's theory of general relativity
[00:18.56] we'll have to make a couple of comments
[00:20.40] on special relativity and the
[00:23.36] consequences
[00:24.72] of the principles of the equivalence
[00:27.12] principle and mark's principle that we
[00:29.36] are adopting in formulating
[00:31.12] general relativity the first comment to
[00:33.84] make is that the equivalence principle
[00:35.20] itself implies
[00:36.24] that it's impossible in general to set
[00:38.24] up a family of inertial observers to
[00:40.32] measure the gravitational force
[00:43.36] we can't and the problem is we just
[00:44.96] can't insulate an observer
[00:46.96] from gravity any observer
[00:50.08] according to the equivalence principle
[00:51.68] will move in exactly the same way as a
[00:53.52] test body
[00:54.32] and there is no natural background
[00:56.24] motion to compare with
[00:57.52] a test body so that's the the main
[01:00.72] problem
[01:01.44] with thinking of gravity as a force
[01:03.76] within general relativity
[01:06.80] so this is actually in a fundamental
[01:09.12] hypothesis
[01:10.00] in general relativity and what i'll do
[01:12.80] is i'll
[01:15.20] write this out a little bit more
[01:16.32] explicitly and name
[01:22.24] the fundamental hypotheses of hypothesis
[01:25.52] of general relativity
[01:36.32] explicitly so let's sort of review
[01:41.84] general relativity as we've somewhat
[01:43.44] vaguely formulated it
[01:44.88] built on the equivalence principle
[01:46.16] mark's principle and now
[01:48.24] make it much more precise indeed this is
[01:50.24] the formulation that we're going to be
[01:52.64] uh carrying forward in our discussion of
[01:55.36] einstein's
[01:56.08] general theory of relativity so the
[01:58.32] fundamental hypothesis of general
[01:59.60] relativity reads
[02:02.16] that space time
[02:05.84] is a manifold
[02:12.96] m
[02:17.12] on which is defined
[02:22.00] a lawrence metric g
[02:28.56] we'll say gab to emphasize the fact that
[02:30.88] it's got
[02:31.76] two tensorial components and further
[02:37.12] you know before i see the further
[02:41.60] i should point out as a side remark
[02:46.08] that the manifold
[02:49.52] m can be a lot
[02:52.64] more general than just minkowski space
[03:07.92] so incorporated into the fundamental
[03:10.40] hypothesis of general relativity is the
[03:12.00] fact that
[03:12.48] spacetime itself need no longer be flat
[03:17.68] in fact it can be topologically
[03:19.36] different from minkowski
[03:21.44] space
[03:25.20] so that's the first part of the
[03:26.56] fundamental hypothesis of
[03:28.80] general relativity but there's more to
[03:32.08] it there's also
[03:35.44] the fact that
[03:40.88] space-time is not necessarily fat flat
[03:46.72] you'd have topologically different
[03:48.40] manifolds but they could be still flat
[03:51.36] but here it's allowed in the fundamental
[03:53.60] hypothesis of general relativity for
[03:55.04] space-time
[03:56.24] to be not flat so not necessarily
[04:00.16] flat
[04:05.60] and also the world lines and this is
[04:08.32] where we incorporate the
[04:09.76] equivalence principle
[04:16.48] of freely falling bodies
[04:25.68] are geodesics
[04:34.72] of the curved
[04:38.72] metric g
[04:45.04] so this is going to be the fundamental
[04:48.24] hypothesis of general relativity for us
[04:50.00] going forward
[04:55.76] and we are going to build general
[04:58.32] relativity on this fundamental
[04:59.60] hypothesis
[05:00.40] we'll see that we're not yet quite there
[05:01.84] yet we need a way to
[05:03.52] build equations of motions equations of
[05:06.64] motion
[05:07.20] for various physical systems we'll need
[05:10.08] principles to guide us in selecting
[05:11.68] these equations of motion well further
[05:13.36] we also need to
[05:16.56] provide a quantitative way to describe
[05:18.96] the equation of motion of spacetime
[05:20.40] itself
[05:20.88] and so that will require the addition of
[05:23.20] mark's principle
[05:24.80] anyway for the next part of this lecture
[05:26.32] we're going to start building on this
[05:27.52] fundamental hypothesis
[05:29.84] now it's worth saying that the
[05:33.60] in certain situations it is sort of
[05:35.68] possible to
[05:36.72] measure the gravitational force
[05:42.64] and that's that's something that you you
[05:44.16] know
[05:46.16] we should comment on explicitly
[05:52.88] so the cases of time translation
[06:00.32] symmetry so if for some reason you have
[06:03.28] a setup where your system is invariant
[06:05.92] under time translations
[06:08.80] or your background you have somehow a
[06:10.80] strong background that's invariant under
[06:12.40] time translations
[06:14.72] one can define a preferred setup
[06:25.68] background
[06:29.60] family of observers of inertial
[06:32.84] observers
[06:36.72] and you can therefore thereby you know
[06:39.60] sort of
[06:40.00] measure a gravitational
[06:44.00] force but with only respect to this this
[06:47.04] family
[06:58.00] so it's possible and you know what
[06:59.60] situation are we talking about well
[07:01.12] we're talking about
[07:02.80] here on earth so we have one heavenly
[07:05.68] body the earth
[07:06.88] where the this heavenly body is in
[07:10.40] you know in absence of the rest of the
[07:11.92] universe it's it generates a
[07:14.00] gravitational field
[07:15.36] that is invariant under time
[07:16.96] translations then we can set up a
[07:18.80] preferred set of background
[07:20.64] observers with respect to which we can
[07:22.48] measure the gravitational force
[07:24.64] of the earth and
[07:28.16] and then we're all happy and so that's
[07:30.88] that does apply
[07:31.84] in this very particular situation of one
[07:34.08] one heavenly body
[07:35.52] however the minute we have two or even
[07:37.76] three in motion
[07:38.96] then the system is no longer invariant
[07:40.72] under time translations
[07:42.40] and it's impossible to set up a
[07:44.56] background preferred background
[07:46.72] set of observers to measure a
[07:48.16] gravitational force with respect to
[07:53.44] so although the fundamental hypothesis
[07:56.80] of general relativity pretty much
[07:58.48] excludes uh
[08:00.08] setting up a um preferred background
[08:02.48] observers
[08:03.92] um there are you know we can still
[08:06.96] measure things
[08:07.92] to do with gravity uh so
[08:12.96] i'm gonna write that down we know why we
[08:15.60] cannot measure the gravitational
[08:21.28] force directly
[08:31.28] so while we can't measure the
[08:32.32] gravitational force in general
[08:33.52] situations we can always
[08:35.92] measure the relative acceleration of
[08:38.00] nearby geodesics
[08:54.08] that's well defined
[08:58.64] and hence we can speak of tidal forces
[09:06.72] meaningfully in general relativity
[09:13.20] so that's an important observation in
[09:14.56] fact it's a critical observation when it
[09:16.24] comes to formulating einstein's field
[09:17.84] equations
[09:20.88] so given this fundamental hypothesis of
[09:22.64] general relativity how do we actually
[09:24.24] determine
[09:25.20] uh the laws of physics in general
[09:27.04] relativity
[09:29.44] well there's two key principles that you
[09:32.80] can employ
[09:38.32] to determine the laws of physics
[09:48.08] i mean we don't get to we don't have to
[09:49.76] do everything in a vacuum we can really
[09:52.00] uh take guidance from two key principles
[09:55.52] i mean this isn't
[09:56.56] these are not these two principles are
[09:58.32] not like 100 mathematically rigorously
[10:00.56] well defined
[10:01.44] but they are so helpful as guiding
[10:03.92] principles that you pretty much
[10:05.36] um can uniquely identify the correct
[10:09.04] laws of physics for the situation
[10:10.72] they're interested in
[10:12.56] so what's the key principles of the
[10:14.24] first one is the principle of
[10:16.56] of general covariance that's the first
[10:19.28] core principle
[10:22.08] that uh we're gonna that one can
[10:25.52] can and should use to determine
[10:27.60] equations of motion
[10:30.08] laws of physics in general relativity
[10:32.96] and the principle of general covariance
[10:35.04] says that only the metric
[10:38.24] basically is allowed to appear
[10:41.36] as a uh
[10:45.04] representing the space-time geometry
[10:50.00] in equations of motion
[11:01.84] so only the metric and quantities
[11:03.44] derivable from
[11:05.36] the metric
[11:10.40] may appear oh
[11:15.68] are the only
[11:21.36] space-time quantities
[11:29.12] that can appear in laws of physics
[11:35.52] laws meaning equations right
[11:44.48] so if you want to formulate a law of
[11:45.84] physics and you want to make reference
[11:48.00] to the
[11:48.64] the geometry it's based on geometry
[11:50.72] somehow like i don't know in terms of
[11:52.40] position or something
[11:53.76] then you better not be referring to
[11:56.16] anything other than
[11:57.68] a quantity derivable from the metrics so
[12:00.48] in particular you're not allowed to
[12:02.08] refer to say
[12:02.96] the position in some coordinate system
[12:05.20] that's already been
[12:07.20] captured earlier qualitatively in the
[12:09.44] principle
[12:14.16] in our discussion of the core principles
[12:17.12] underlying special relativity for
[12:18.56] example
[12:21.20] now that's not quite enough to help us
[12:23.44] in formulating the laws of physics in
[12:25.60] in in uh general relativity but here's
[12:28.48] the second principle that more or less
[12:30.00] does it for us
[12:31.28] and that says that the equations of
[12:32.88] physics
[12:36.56] you know if you kind of come up with
[12:37.52] some equations of physics in gr
[12:39.76] they must reduce
[12:44.24] to their special relativity versions
[12:50.32] for the case where g a b
[12:53.68] is flat right
[12:57.04] that seems like a pretty safe
[13:00.08] principle
[13:05.36] because if that weren't true then you
[13:07.44] know we would have
[13:08.96] uh we wouldn't accept special relativity
[13:12.88] as somehow a limiting case of general
[13:14.24] relativity
[13:16.64] so we have to point out that these two
[13:18.08] principles are somewhat imprecise
[13:20.80] and they don't actually uniquely define
[13:23.04] the laws of physics or determine the
[13:24.40] laws of physics
[13:25.44] but they are very very helpful as
[13:27.68] guiding principles
[13:29.12] for identifying candidate laws or
[13:31.28] natural
[13:32.16] physical laws
[13:36.32] all right so according to these
[13:37.76] principles
[13:39.44] let's start let's get started in
[13:41.04] identifying the laws of physics for the
[13:42.88] motion of
[13:43.60] free particles
[13:56.88] so we've got um
[14:06.32] we're going to continue
[14:11.04] to represent
[14:14.56] physical quantities by tensorial objects
[14:18.00] just as we do in special relativity
[14:27.60] so the velocity is a vector
[14:32.24] stress energy is a tensor that kind of
[14:42.84] thing
[14:45.60] so here's a couple of bullet points that
[14:47.44] will
[14:52.56] summarizing this statement so for
[14:54.88] example particle motion
[14:57.20] is represented by
[15:00.24] time-like curves
[15:12.48] uh what's another principle the four
[15:14.64] velocity of a particle will continue to
[15:16.64] be represented as a tangent vector
[15:18.96] to a world line
[15:49.76] and unit means we're measuring it
[15:54.40] with respect to the metric
[15:59.68] so these kind of quantities don't we
[16:01.84] don't posit new quantities to
[16:03.68] to define old concepts but we do have to
[16:07.36] update the way the equations of motions
[16:09.52] or amend the equations of motion
[16:16.56] so you know we're no longer doing
[16:18.24] newton's laws here so free
[16:21.68] we have to update the equations of
[16:22.96] motion and how do we update the
[16:24.16] equations of motion well
[16:25.52] for free particle
[16:29.60] i'll just before i get to jump into that
[16:46.96] so while we don't change the tensorial
[16:49.20] quantities representing
[16:54.40] physical properties and special
[16:55.52] relativity we do update the equations of
[16:57.28] motion
[16:59.92] and in particular
[17:04.24] free particle
[17:08.24] motion or the free particle equation of
[17:10.96] motion becomes the geodesic equation
[17:24.72] all right that's the first updated
[17:28.40] law of physics so in the absence of any
[17:31.68] exterior forces
[17:33.52] external forces a free particle will
[17:35.84] move along a geodesic as per the
[17:37.76] fundamental hypothesis of general
[17:40.00] relativity
[17:41.20] and we even have an equation of motion
[17:43.20] determining a geodesic now
[17:45.12] and that is determined with respect to
[17:46.48] the genera the derivative operator delta
[17:48.56] determined by the metric g
[18:03.76] and so we can now define
[18:06.88] the acceleration
[18:16.00] analogously
[18:25.92] so the acceleration is given by
[18:29.12] well the change along the world line of
[18:32.16] the velocity
[18:37.60] so if it's uh which is zero right for
[18:40.48] something in in a
[18:42.96] a free particle
[18:46.80] and when it's not zero then we say that
[18:49.68] a force is acting
[18:50.72] on the test particle
[19:03.84] f what's the force that acts on the
[19:05.44] particle well it's the force is just
[19:07.68] m the initial mass of the particle
[19:11.36] the rest mass of the particle
[19:14.72] multiplied by the acceleration
[19:33.68] so it's not new it's not newton's second
[19:35.76] law but you know
[19:37.68] looks pretty close we've just updated
[19:41.92] the notion of acceleration to be defined
[19:44.64] in terms of the derivative
[19:45.84] operator associated to a metric
[19:49.92] accordingly we also define the four
[19:52.80] momentum
[20:01.60] of the particle
[20:09.76] how do we define that well you just take
[20:13.84] the rest mass and multiplied by
[20:17.04] the unit vector representing
[20:20.80] the tangent to the geodesic that the
[20:24.32] particle is following
[20:28.16] if it's freely moving
[20:33.68] and now we've got the four momentum we
[20:36.08] can define the energy but now you have
[20:37.68] to be a little bit careful
[20:38.80] the energy as it'll turn out uh
[20:42.64] cannot be defined globally this is a
[20:45.44] really
[20:46.84] important
[20:49.36] property of general relativity but we
[20:50.88] can certainly define the energy locally
[20:52.48] so the energy
[20:54.24] now who determines the energy well an
[20:56.00] observer determines the energy
[21:05.36] so the observer who can determine
[21:08.72] to determine the energy of the particles
[21:10.48] to be present
[21:12.96] at the particle's world line right
[21:16.16] we'll see i'll explain more in a second
[21:37.36] so the observer who's going to try and
[21:39.68] define the energy
[21:41.04] will has to be present at the
[21:44.48] an event on the particle's world line
[21:48.24] and that that observer will determine
[21:50.00] the energy to be
[21:51.52] minus the momentum of the particle
[21:58.08] the scalar product of the momentum with
[22:00.48] the
[22:01.12] velocity of the observer
[22:04.80] so of course an observer who moves with
[22:06.72] the test particle will say that the
[22:08.00] particle has no energy
[22:09.84] well apart from the rest mass synergy
[22:29.92] so now why can't we define energy
[22:33.28] for a particle somewhere else not
[22:35.52] present on the world line
[22:37.84] or on the observer's world line well
[22:40.08] because space-time is curved
[22:42.40] there's the parallel transport is path
[22:45.12] dependent
[22:45.92] so there's no notion of a natural family
[22:47.84] of inertial observers
[22:49.20] and a given observer cannot in general
[22:51.44] define the energy of a distant particle
[23:13.84] because you see you need two vectorial
[23:15.52] quantities to define the energy you need
[23:17.44] to multiply the momentum of the particle
[23:19.36] and the velocity of the observer or take
[23:21.68] the scalar product
[23:27.36] and because in a general curve manifold
[23:29.68] parallel transport
[23:30.96] is just not it is just path depending
[23:42.72] so you might try and you know formulate
[23:45.60] a protocol whereby you measure the
[23:46.88] energy of distant particles by only
[23:48.40] moving along certain para
[23:50.72] world lines but
[23:54.24] in the general curve manifold there is
[23:55.84] no distinguished
[23:57.92] preferred background frame of inertial
[23:59.92] observers so there is no real way to
[24:01.76] just to distinguish a preferred parallel
[24:04.40] transport path to measure the energies
[24:06.16] of distant particles
[24:09.28] so in this summary of the
[24:13.92] kinematics of single particles we've
[24:17.04] already witnessed
[24:18.24] uh the application of
[24:21.52] the two principles determining the laws
[24:23.76] of physics and general relativity
[24:26.00] the metric we've the metric does appear
[24:28.64] in these expressions certainly
[24:30.00] implicitly in the definition of the
[24:32.16] derivative operator
[24:33.52] and also in scalar products between the
[24:35.76] momentum and the observer
[24:37.76] for velocities and momenta and
[24:40.80] also it's pretty clear i hope right that
[24:42.96] these these equations are motion reduced
[24:44.64] to their special relativity versions
[24:47.12] just replace the derivative operator
[24:49.84] determined by the metric by the one
[24:51.12] determined by the flat matrix
[24:54.24] and so you can see
[24:57.28] that in applying these principles
[25:00.56] we're somehow exploiting
[25:04.08] a following sort of min what we might
[25:06.00] call minimal substitution rules
[25:11.36] and we can you know make this a bit more
[25:13.04] explicit
[25:15.28] by saying that general relativity
[25:17.12] friendly
[25:22.72] equations of motion how do you how might
[25:24.88] you find them well there's a kind of
[25:26.84] uh
[25:32.24] let's say usually not always right
[25:49.68] they can usually be found by applying
[25:51.28] the following minimal substitution rules
[25:53.44] so in special relativity the
[25:56.96] flat metric eta a b gets mapped in
[25:59.76] general relativity
[26:02.56] to just a general metric gab and in
[26:05.44] special relativity
[26:06.80] when you have a derivative operator just
[26:09.12] the unusual derivative operator in
[26:10.96] general relativity you replace that with
[26:12.72] the covariance derivative
[26:14.08] determined by the metric
[26:18.72] and in this way we can build up a whole
[26:21.12] bunch of
[26:23.04] hypothesis equations of motion for
[26:26.48] field theories and and beyond
[26:29.60] so let's give some examples of applying
[26:32.16] these minimal substitute substitution
[26:34.24] rules
[26:37.04] well one of them is this is going to be
[26:40.72] simpler than the field theory that will
[26:43.52] occupy us for the rest of this course
[26:47.04] because the field theory of principle
[26:48.96] interest and general relativity is that
[26:50.40] of
[26:50.72] fluid dynamics some pretty complicated
[26:53.04] field theories in several fields
[26:54.56] involved in
[26:55.20] formulating fluid mechanics before we
[26:56.64] even do fluid mechanics let's let's
[26:59.20] experiment with a far simpler field
[27:01.60] theory
[27:02.24] namely scalar field theory circle known
[27:05.20] as the
[27:05.68] klein gordon field let's apply these
[27:09.12] minimal substitution rules to see what
[27:10.64] we get
[27:11.36] see what kinds of equations of motion we
[27:12.96] get
[27:14.64] so in special relativity the klein
[27:16.32] gordon field is determined by a lagrange
[27:18.84] density
[27:21.44] you don't need to worry about the grunge
[27:22.72] densities if you don't know about
[27:23.84] lagrange densities yet
[27:26.08] because i'll write out the equation of
[27:27.36] motion anyway
[27:31.20] so by varying this lagrange density you
[27:32.88] get the equation of motion
[27:35.36] that's the thing that we're going to
[27:36.32] modify right now
[27:41.12] you get the equation of motion delta a
[27:42.96] delta a
[27:44.24] phi minus m squared phi is zero so
[27:47.28] that's the klein gordon field
[27:49.04] in special relativity plays a hugely
[27:51.04] important role in
[27:52.08] in quantum field theory as well as in
[27:54.32] classical field theory
[27:56.08] now how might you get the general
[27:57.20] relativity version well in general
[27:59.28] relativity remember what we have to do
[28:00.80] we have to replace
[28:02.48] the delta a's with the big covariance
[28:05.44] derivatives
[28:06.24] so just looking at that equation of
[28:07.76] motion the first thing you might guess
[28:09.52] and you're welcome to guess it
[28:13.12] is just to replace deltas with
[28:16.56] covariance derivatives and there you go
[28:18.08] that's that's
[28:19.84] one perfectly well behaved
[28:23.36] general
[28:26.72] general relativity friendly formulation
[28:28.88] of scalar field theory
[28:34.32] the stress energy tensor for this
[28:36.48] particular
[28:39.44] scalar field theory a couple of ways you
[28:41.92] can argue what the stress energy tensor
[28:46.08] is one of them if you know anything
[28:48.24] about classical field theory is to apply
[28:50.16] notice theorem
[28:55.12] with respect to the symmetries of
[28:56.84] translation
[29:00.88] or you can just believe me it's also
[29:02.96] fine
[29:11.12] another clever way to get the stress
[29:12.64] energy tensor is to vary the metric
[29:15.60] of the action it'll get you the stress
[29:18.00] energy tensor as well
[29:22.00] there are some differences between these
[29:23.36] ways of getting the stress energy tensor
[29:24.72] but for here
[29:25.52] we end up with the following
[29:36.32] equation of conservation equation i'll
[29:38.48] say conservation but i'm going to argue
[29:40.00] later it's not actually a conservation
[29:41.36] equation you end up with the following
[29:43.52] equation
[29:46.96] of motion for the stressed energy tensor
[29:49.12] of the klein gordon field
[29:51.44] namely that the uh divergence
[29:55.52] with respect to a derivative operator
[29:57.44] determined by the manifold is zero
[30:02.00] now it's important to note
[30:06.48] that this is not the only generalization
[30:20.84] possible
[30:25.20] there are in fact other generalizations
[30:27.28] that you could very
[30:28.48] uh you could very meaningfully add to
[30:31.60] the equation of motion
[30:35.44] for example you could
[30:40.88] add the term to the equation of motion
[30:43.68] which is
[30:44.40] some constant alpha
[30:47.44] times r the richie scalar times phi
[30:57.28] that term certainly reduces to its
[30:59.28] special relativity version in
[31:01.36] the case where the metric is flat r
[31:03.60] vanishes
[31:05.20] and it contains only the metric
[31:08.24] in a nicely contracted way so that's
[31:11.52] a possible term you could add it's not
[31:13.36] the minimal substitution
[31:15.52] but it is a possible substitution so
[31:18.24] there
[31:18.56] are and sometimes these these added
[31:21.52] terms
[31:22.64] it is possible to argue that they are in
[31:24.24] fact more appropriate to describe
[31:26.24] certain physical situations
[31:29.36] okay so that's a kind of warm up the the
[31:31.12] klein gordon field is a kind of warm-up
[31:32.64] problem
[31:33.68] for the field theory that is of
[31:36.88] primary importance in in general
[31:38.64] relativity in particular in cosmology
[31:41.04] namely that of
[31:44.24] a perfect fluid
[31:51.44] so the perfect fluid
[31:55.44] is a field theory it's a field theory
[31:56.96] with a velocity field a pressure field
[31:58.80] and a density field
[32:00.80] so there's lots of fields interacting
[32:17.76] it pertains to a continuous distribution
[32:19.76] of matter
[32:25.92] and the way we destroy describe the
[32:29.44] state of this this matter
[32:31.12] is with the stress energy tensor so if
[32:34.32] you remember
[32:34.96] the discussion of the stress energy
[32:36.32] tensor several lectures ago
[32:38.64] um it describes the density of positions
[32:42.40] and
[32:42.80] momentum of all the particles that make
[32:44.72] up the matter
[32:48.64] and the stress energy tensor of
[32:52.16] a perfect fluid has a certain form and
[32:54.08] it's this form here
[33:00.64] and you can argue that this is the
[33:02.16] correct form by
[33:03.76] taking the continuum limit of the stress
[33:06.72] energy tensor of a bunch of particles
[33:12.64] so here rho is the density so it's a
[33:15.68] field
[33:17.12] now p is the pressure
[33:24.32] and ua is a
[33:28.00] velocity field
[33:41.36] and it represents
[33:46.00] the full velocity of the fluid
[33:54.96] now the equation of motion of a perfect
[34:04.84] fluid
[34:20.00] you can find it by taking the
[34:23.04] the divergence the four divergence
[34:27.68] of the stress energy tensor
[34:33.12] so that's the special relativity way to
[34:35.20] describe
[34:36.48] a perfect fluid you describe it by the
[34:39.20] stress energy tensor
[34:40.40] and the equation of motion is just the
[34:42.40] four divergence is
[34:43.60] is vanishing and as i'll argue later or
[34:46.80] as i'll remind you later that that just
[34:48.72] pertains to the conservation of of
[34:50.96] energy
[34:52.24] however in general relativity uh i
[34:54.56] didn't i de-emphasized you know this
[34:56.48] previous prior discussion of
[34:57.84] the stress energy tends to de-emphasize
[34:59.92] the role of
[35:02.48] the for divergence being a conservation
[35:05.04] law
[35:05.52] um because as we'll see in general
[35:06.64] relativity we have to revise our
[35:08.16] understanding
[35:09.68] of these things a little so in general
[35:11.92] relativity
[35:13.20] how do we get the stress energy tensor
[35:15.28] of a perfect fluid well it's the same
[35:16.64] story we apply the two principles above
[35:19.12] and the minimal substitution rule so
[35:20.80] there was a metric now we've got to
[35:21.92] replace our metric with gab
[35:24.08] and nowhere else do we have to do
[35:25.68] anything and we impose
[35:30.40] guess right you know you have to have to
[35:32.56] make clear that the minimal substitution
[35:34.32] rule is a guess
[35:36.24] and you have to argue provide
[35:38.80] independent arguments why it's correct
[35:47.60] so the simplest equation of motion you
[35:49.76] can impose on the forward
[35:51.60] on on the stress energy tension general
[35:53.20] relativity is that this
[35:55.44] the covariance derivative contracted
[35:59.12] on the first argument is zero
[36:02.32] on the first tensor
[36:06.00] argument leg zero
[36:13.36] might call this star star
[36:20.00] now we these equations of motion that
[36:22.32] i've written here there's 16 of them
[36:24.40] um in the the red box there 16 equations
[36:28.00] of motion for the stress energy tensor
[36:30.08] but we can actually uh since the stress
[36:32.32] energy tensor is symmetric
[36:34.64] we can uh reduce the number of equations
[36:36.96] of motion and put them in a slightly
[36:38.16] more familiar form
[36:42.24] and you can do that by projecting
[36:47.44] the equation onto components
[36:53.12] parallel and perpendicular
[37:02.88] to you
[37:06.16] and when you do that you get the
[37:07.84] following two equations of motion
[37:09.92] which might look slightly more familiar
[37:12.00] one is like the conservation
[37:14.40] equation
[37:18.64] and the other one is like euler's
[37:20.84] equation
[37:22.72] pertaining to the derivative of the
[37:26.24] velocity field
[37:41.44] you check in the non-relativistic limit
[37:43.36] that this all
[37:44.64] you know first you go to the special
[37:46.08] relativity element where you replace g
[37:47.92] with
[37:48.48] eta and delta the covariance derivative
[37:51.36] with delta
[37:52.16] and then you can go to the
[37:53.04] non-relativistic limit where the speed
[37:54.88] of light is much greater than any
[37:56.08] velocity in the
[37:57.12] in your your setup and then you'll end
[37:59.84] up back with the conservation law
[38:01.76] euler's equation that you would know
[38:03.60] from non-relativistic physics
[38:10.00] so now i'll just comment on
[38:11.80] [Music]
[38:16.00] the interpretation
[38:21.20] of the stress energy tensor in gr
[38:30.24] so it's important to know that there's a
[38:32.96] distinction in how we can are allowed to
[38:34.96] interpret the stress energy tensor and
[38:36.64] general relativity as opposed to or as
[38:38.56] compared with special relativity
[38:41.44] so the first thing to note or to do is
[38:44.32] to just revise or remind you
[38:46.24] how we interpret the stress energy
[38:48.00] tensor in
[38:49.36] in special relativity
[39:19.20] so an observing special relativity an
[39:21.04] observer with forbidden full velocity va
[39:25.28] interprets the quantity
[39:28.64] t a b v a v b
[39:32.16] as an energy density
[39:45.44] more specifically the mass
[39:48.88] energy density per unit volume
[40:03.36] for the observer okay you can go ahead
[40:06.40] and
[40:06.88] just verify that it's an exercise right
[40:08.96] we talked about i introduced the stress
[40:10.48] energy tensor
[40:12.88] several several lectures ago and uh you
[40:15.60] can take that definition that we
[40:16.80] supplied there and just check that
[40:18.32] interpretation
[40:22.48] further right
[40:27.52] if x a is orthogonal
[40:34.16] to b a then the quantity
[40:38.00] minus t a b v a x b
[40:42.48] is the momentum density of matter in the
[40:44.80] x a direction
[40:46.40] or is interpreted
[41:06.80] so
[41:18.84] so d a
[41:23.68] the four divergence of the stress energy
[41:25.36] tensor
[41:28.72] in special relativity then gets
[41:32.48] interpreted or may be interpreted as a
[41:34.16] conservation law
[41:53.36] so how do you do that well you apply
[41:55.12] gauss's gas law
[42:07.44] and uh
[42:16.72] and then you'll be able to interpret
[42:23.52] gauss's law as imposing a conservation
[42:27.04] law for a current
[42:30.40] now before we do that
[42:36.00] we have to say a couple of words about
[42:38.16] how to set up
[42:39.04] this this situation
[42:43.76] because we are in special relativity we
[42:45.76] can set up
[42:49.68] or we assume that we can in principle
[42:59.84] set up a family
[43:04.64] of inertial observers
[43:13.36] which have a certain property namely
[43:14.80] that they all have parallel full
[43:24.84] velocities
[43:28.08] and what does parallel mean in this
[43:29.36] context it just means if you take the
[43:30.80] derivative
[43:32.56] of the full velocity field defined by
[43:35.04] this family of inertial observers
[43:37.12] that that full velocity that that
[43:40.32] derivative is zero so here's a picture
[43:43.84] of this
[43:44.40] you know you've got four velocity
[43:45.92] observers you've got observers all
[43:48.08] marching forward in
[43:50.72] a nice grid of observers and they're all
[43:53.12] moving
[43:55.76] parallel to each other with respect to
[43:58.64] some
[43:59.36] inertial reference frame
[44:08.56] when you have this velocity field
[44:10.56] determined
[44:11.60] by this family of inertial observers
[44:14.56] then you can set up a current
[44:20.88] we can set up the following current j a
[44:23.60] is just minus t
[44:24.80] a b contracted with v all right
[44:28.00] so we've got a current where v is the
[44:30.88] velocity
[44:31.60] of these velocity fielders these
[44:33.60] observers so we have a current density
[44:37.20] and now this the
[44:43.92] the equation d a d a b is 0
[44:47.84] implies the divergence free equation
[44:51.04] d a j a is zero so j a is really like a
[44:53.92] current
[44:54.72] and then you can integrate that equation
[44:59.20] to to derive conservation laws so you
[45:02.08] set up a fictitious
[45:05.76] pill box in space time and then you can
[45:09.52] integrate this current
[45:12.72] and apply gauss's law to learn
[45:14.80] conservation laws for the four current
[45:19.12] now this is the the story one tells in
[45:22.16] special relativity to interpret the the
[45:25.12] law of motion
[45:26.00] delta a tab for a stress energy tensor
[45:28.88] however in general relativity
[45:30.72] uh we have some some challenges some
[45:33.20] problems
[45:34.64] that prevent us from interpreting these
[45:36.64] things in the same way
[45:43.60] we can still represent families
[45:45.84] observers
[45:46.80] of observers sorry with a velocity field
[45:59.44] so a family of observers may still be
[46:01.28] represented by velocity field v
[46:03.52] where v is unit and time-like
[46:10.32] then the condition that the full
[46:11.52] velocities however are parallel that
[46:13.36] they're all moving
[46:14.64] you know in parallel to each other
[46:19.04] has to be changed
[46:30.08] according to the minimal substitution
[46:31.68] rule we would guess
[46:38.56] that the condition for a family of
[46:42.00] observers
[46:42.88] to be moving parallel to each other is
[46:44.48] the covariance derivative of the
[46:46.96] components of the velocity field is zero
[46:50.80] or
[46:54.84] equivalently that
[46:58.00] d delta a v b
[47:01.28] symmetrizes zero this is an equation
[47:04.56] we're going to meet a little bit later
[47:05.68] in the course
[47:06.88] called killing's equation
[47:15.12] and so this looks all fine right you
[47:18.32] know maybe we can
[47:19.28] always solve killings equation right and
[47:22.48] then we can maybe we can set up this
[47:24.24] current vector
[47:25.60] j and then we can in uh infer
[47:29.20] the conservation of this four current uh
[47:32.00] the global conservation of this four
[47:33.44] current from
[47:34.16] a kind of gauss law however
[47:37.28] however and this is the you know i
[47:39.52] already
[47:41.20] discussed this at the beginning of this
[47:42.72] lecture
[47:45.04] uh in your curved space time
[47:52.88] it is generally impossible
[48:02.32] to find such vas
[48:09.52] so it's generally impossible i mean it
[48:11.76] is possible for minkowski but in general
[48:13.68] it is not imp
[48:14.56] it is not possible to find a family of
[48:17.68] observers such that their unit
[48:19.44] timelike and that they that this
[48:22.64] killings equation
[48:23.68] is satisfied and the cat the core
[48:27.36] a really crucial counter example
[48:31.92] that really is pertinent to the to the
[48:33.84] space time that we live in
[48:35.76] is diesel spacetime
[48:40.80] in dc the space time it's impossible to
[48:42.88] find a global
[48:44.24] time-like uh killing vector field which
[48:46.88] would be the thing solving this
[48:48.00] killings equation that means you can't
[48:50.64] define
[48:51.60] a global notion a notion of global
[48:54.40] energy
[48:54.96] and therefore you can't infer
[49:01.04] from the equation of motion delta a t a
[49:03.28] b equals zero
[49:05.36] you can't infer uh
[49:08.40] strict energy conservation
[49:28.84] uh
[49:35.36] physically you can interpret this also
[49:37.36] physically
[49:39.36] as saying that tidal forces do work
[49:47.68] and how the tidal forces act on
[49:49.52] something well by the gravitational
[49:56.84] field
[50:13.44] so global energy conservation is not
[50:16.08] implied by the equation of motion of a
[50:18.08] perfect fluid in general relativity
[50:20.16] however it is possible to still regard
[50:22.96] this equation of motion
[50:24.24] as a local conservation of energy
[50:29.36] so if we name it star star which i have
[51:13.92] so you are allowed to regard the
[51:16.88] equation star star which is the
[51:18.80] divergence free
[51:20.08] general relativity divergence free
[51:21.60] equation of motion for the stress energy
[51:22.96] tense you are allowed to regard it as a
[51:25.52] conservation law locally if the
[51:27.68] gravitational field is sufficiently
[51:29.52] small
[51:30.32] and the region which you're looking at
[51:31.52] is sufficiently flat so that you can set
[51:33.60] up
[51:33.84] effectively a family a local family of
[51:37.76] inertial observers background family of
[51:40.08] inertial observers which are moving
[51:41.44] parallel to each other
[51:44.64] okay so that's a little tour through a
[51:46.24] couple of three settings
[51:48.56] three equations of motion in general
[51:50.40] relativity and how to discover them via
[51:52.32] these principles of general covariance
[51:54.56] and the principles that equations of
[51:55.92] motion ought to reduce to the special
[51:57.28] relativity versions when the
[51:58.56] gravitational field is sufficiently
[52:00.08] small
[52:01.84] now these this these principles only get
[52:03.60] you so far
[52:05.36] they get you far enough that you can
[52:07.20] work out equations of motions for
[52:09.20] various physical situations
[52:10.96] but there's one physical quantity which
[52:13.28] it doesn't tell you
[52:14.32] how to uh quantize uh not quantize
[52:17.76] sorry there's one physical quantity
[52:19.60] which it doesn't tell you how to j
[52:22.64] doesn't tell you the equation of motion
[52:24.72] of and that is namely space time
[52:26.32] itself so that brings us to the topic
[52:30.16] of einstein's equation
[52:43.28] so as i've emphasized throughout this
[52:45.44] course space time
[52:46.96] and general relativity space time itself
[52:51.20] is dynamical
[52:56.96] which means it changes in response to
[52:59.68] things
[53:00.32] so we need to have an equation of motion
[53:02.00] for space-time
[53:07.76] and the equatio therefore we need an
[53:09.92] equation of motion
[53:10.88] for something quantifying space time and
[53:13.60] reporting according to the principle of
[53:14.96] general covariance at least
[53:16.40] this had better be an equation of motion
[53:19.76] for the metric
[53:32.96] and that's a core equation of motion
[53:35.28] that we need in order to move forward in
[53:37.60] formulating special
[53:38.72] general relativity and how do we find
[53:42.40] this equation of motion well
[53:44.00] uh we need to we need some kind of
[53:47.60] principle to guide us
[53:49.36] and that's where mark's principle comes
[53:51.60] in to play
[53:55.28] that space-time geometry one reading of
[53:58.64] mark's principle would be is that
[54:00.16] space-time
[54:00.88] geometry is influenced by
[54:04.08] matter distribution
[54:19.36] okay that's that's a key principle great
[54:23.20] that's that's sort of helpful but not
[54:25.68] right i mean
[54:27.68] thanks but no thanks we need a bit more
[54:30.16] to make this quantitative right at the
[54:31.92] moment it's very
[54:32.88] qualitative as a statement we need an
[54:34.80] actual equation of motion
[54:36.16] that that's involving the metric and
[54:38.80] some derivatives maybe
[54:40.16] or something like that
[54:50.00] and the trick the clue
[54:56.64] is to look at tidal forces and how
[54:58.16] they're calculated
[55:16.72] and in fact we're going to look all the
[55:17.92] way back to newtonian physics for
[55:19.36] guidance
[55:28.00] so
[55:33.36] i mean we we somehow have in the back of
[55:36.08] our minds in this discussion here that
[55:37.44] we have a heavenly body
[55:39.44] and we have two two test particles
[55:41.52] moving
[55:42.64] in the gravitational field of this
[55:44.08] heavenly body here's one
[55:46.56] and here's another one and
[55:50.00] they're on slightly different orbits
[55:53.68] that's an appallingly bad rendition of
[55:55.52] two test particles on slightly different
[55:57.20] orbits
[55:58.08] anyway you get the idea okay
[56:02.56] so i'll try to really try to get this a
[56:05.20] bit better
[56:06.56] and
[56:13.60] so the earth let's say it's the earth
[56:15.76] and a test particle is a little
[56:17.04] spaceship
[56:18.88] uh one you know the earth is one of the
[56:23.28] the foci of the ellipse
[56:26.96] and then we have another another orbits
[56:32.88] of another spaceship that's nearby and
[56:35.28] so along this orbit these two spaceships
[56:37.84] move relative to each other
[56:44.24] and you can solve you know go through
[56:46.40] the whole keplerian thing and work out
[56:48.16] the
[56:48.48] the orbits of these two particles and
[56:50.16] you can set up
[56:51.68] uh the equation of motion for the
[56:54.00] relative separation vector
[56:59.92] so if you do this newtonian
[57:02.96] you what would newton tell you to do
[57:04.88] well
[57:06.16] uh well newton wouldn't tell you but you
[57:08.00] know this is how you would do it
[57:10.08] in the newtonian way
[57:14.96] firstly in the modern newtonian way you
[57:17.68] describe the gravitational field by
[57:19.68] the potential
[57:22.80] gravitational potential phi
[57:26.08] and the tidal acceleration vector
[57:47.28] you'd call uh a
[57:53.36] right x is the the relative separation
[57:57.52] and the tidal acceleration like how do
[57:59.44] these these two particles accelerate
[58:01.20] with respect to each other as they orbit
[58:02.88] around
[58:03.52] the planet well that's you you it's
[58:06.72] determined by the following equation
[58:09.12] here which is a good exercise in your
[58:12.16] orbital mechanics
[58:20.32] and this x is the separation relative
[58:30.88] okay great so that's how you calculate
[58:32.88] the the tidal acceleration
[58:34.80] in newtonian physics actually
[58:37.84] in general relativity we've also solved
[58:39.68] this problem
[58:42.00] with the geodesic deviation equation
[59:03.36] remember these two freely falling
[59:04.96] falling bodies these two spacecraft
[59:09.04] they're each moving on a geodesic of
[59:10.80] this gravitational field
[59:13.60] and we know
[59:17.12] that if they're infinitesimally close
[59:20.64] how two geodesics accelerate
[59:24.24] and decelerate with respect to each
[59:26.24] other is directly related to curvature
[59:28.48] and the curvature is quantified by the
[59:30.16] riemann curvature tensor
[59:32.00] and the relative acceleration is
[59:34.16] quantified by
[59:35.28] this geodesic deviation equation
[59:42.24] so here you know
[59:45.84] v is the full velocity
[59:52.40] of the particles
[59:55.76] and x the deviation
[60:05.52] and so this suggests doesn't prove but
[60:08.00] it strongly suggests
[60:16.00] a correspondence
[60:22.64] you know the correspondence it's
[60:24.00] suggesting is well it's just take this
[60:26.64] strip off the relatives
[60:31.12] separation vector from both sides so to
[60:33.44] speak
[60:34.96] and then you ought to have that the
[60:36.40] curvature
[60:39.04] is related to the derivatives of the
[60:42.24] gravitational potential
[60:51.76] with the velocity thrown in there of the
[60:54.24] orbiting particles
[60:57.92] but
[61:01.92] phi is determined by rho
[61:05.60] the distribution of mass energy
[61:14.08] in newtonian theory
[61:24.48] and the equation of determining the
[61:26.88] distribution
[61:28.32] sorry determining the gravitational
[61:30.16] scale of potential is this poisson's
[61:31.52] equation
[61:33.52] but remember right you know i went to
[61:35.52] some lengths
[61:36.84] to explain the interpretation
[61:39.92] of
[61:44.00] the distribution of mass energy
[61:52.72] or energy density
[62:01.20] and that's described
[62:06.56] by the stress energy tensor
[62:14.32] according to t a b
[62:17.60] v a v b where v is the velocity of the
[62:20.32] observer
[62:23.12] um relative to the the the
[62:27.12] the matter at that point along the
[62:28.80] observer's world line
[62:30.88] so we've attained a correspondence
[62:32.40] between the stress energy tensor
[62:35.60] and the energy density of matter thus
[62:40.64] we have a suggested correspondence
[62:46.00] between curvature
[62:52.24] and the stress energy tensor and that's
[62:54.64] exactly the kind of thing we've been
[62:55.76] looking for
[63:14.88] so we put it all together we have the
[63:18.24] stress energy tensor on one side we have
[63:20.16] the vc and the vd the
[63:21.76] the velocity vector of the inertial of
[63:24.88] the of the
[63:25.92] observer moving through this
[63:27.76] gravitational field
[63:29.28] and that implies right
[63:34.96] the following equation namely that the
[63:39.52] rigid tensor is determined by the stress
[63:42.88] energy tensor
[63:45.36] now i'll put a question mark in an
[63:47.44] exclamation mark there
[63:48.80] because it's not correct you know this
[63:52.08] argumentation while very very beautiful
[63:54.80] has a flaw
[64:00.72] now this was in fact einstein's original
[64:04.64] equation
[64:07.92] however he very quickly realized the
[64:10.84] flaw
[64:15.60] it has a floor pretty glaring floor
[64:20.08] namely that
[64:23.68] the divergence of this
[64:26.72] stress energy tensor is not equal to
[64:28.24] zero
[64:30.24] and the reason uh is because of
[64:33.68] bianchi's identity
[64:40.08] of the bianchi identity
[64:44.08] we have that delta c r c d
[64:49.44] which tends to minus a half g c d times
[64:52.08] whether which scalar is zero
[64:55.28] so the only way to reconcile
[65:00.16] the stress into the equation of motion
[65:01.60] for the stress energy tensor and
[65:04.16] this equation i've put the square skirm
[65:08.08] skirt acclimation mark next to would be
[65:10.48] if the richie scaler vanishes
[65:22.72] okay but that's that's not satisfied by
[65:25.36] most interesting
[65:27.76] manifolds but the resolution
[65:32.72] is incredibly simple
[65:37.84] namely consider
[65:40.88] instead
[65:44.72] the equation
[65:47.76] g a b the einstein tensor which is
[65:51.28] r a b minus a half r
[65:54.56] g a b equals eight
[65:57.92] pi t a b so this
[66:04.72] equation is consistent with the
[66:07.76] the divergence condition on the stress
[66:11.60] energy tensor
[66:13.76] and it reduces in the right limits
[66:16.96] to the same
[66:20.16] consequences that i discussed above
[66:23.20] and this indeed is the resolution
[66:28.16] to the goal on the puzzle above
[66:32.96] and provides the connection between
[66:35.60] space-time geometry and
[66:37.04] distribution of matter
[66:41.36] this equation now bears einstein's name
[66:44.80] it's called einstein's equation
[66:46.64] einstein's field equation
[66:52.96] so in this lecture i've taken you
[66:56.56] along the path of trying to understand
[66:59.20] how to generalize
[67:00.24] laws of physics that we know in the
[67:01.52] limit of special relativity
[67:03.28] how to generalize them to the case of
[67:05.28] arbitrary manifolds and hence find their
[67:07.20] general relativistic counterparts
[67:09.44] also by taking mark's principle and
[67:12.32] making a quantitative version
[67:14.24] we are able to discover as einstein did
[67:17.12] that
[67:17.52] there is an equation relating space-time
[67:20.64] geometry as quantified by the metric and
[67:23.68] the distribution of energy density
[67:26.40] stress energy density in space time as
[67:28.24] quantified by the stress energy tensor
[67:30.80] and this led extraordinarily elegantly
[67:33.44] to an equation known as einstein's
[67:35.20] equation
[67:36.72] this amazing equation will be the focus
[67:39.44] of the rest of this course
[67:41.36] we're going to take aim at trying to
[67:44.56] solve this equation we'll fail
[67:46.16] completely except in a couple of very
[67:47.92] very special cases
[67:49.92] and we'll also spend a long time
[67:52.00] interpreting this equation
[67:53.76] for various in various physical
[67:55.20] situations
[67:56.96] it's really this extraordinary equation
[67:59.60] it's very very difficult
[68:01.12] to sort of overstate the amazing
[68:04.88] significance of this equation in the the
[68:07.36] formulation of general relativity as i
[68:09.20] presented it
[68:10.32] today and particularly amazing and i
[68:14.72] hope you'll
[68:15.28] share this sense of wonder as we go
[68:16.96] through this course particularly amazing
[68:19.04] is how everything holds together in a
[68:20.80] self-consistent way
[68:23.04] we'll see that very clearly in the
[68:25.12] coming lecture
[68:26.40] but for now that's it thank you very
[68:28.40] much see you later
