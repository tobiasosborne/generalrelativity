[00:00.00] hello and welcome back to introduction
[00:01.60] to general relativity
[00:03.20] in the last lecture we introduced
[00:05.12] einstein's field equations
[00:06.56] and in today's lecture we're going to
[00:08.00] continue our study of einstein's field
[00:10.00] equations
[00:10.96] study and commence the study of their
[00:13.52] solution
[00:14.96] but only in perturbation theory at the
[00:17.68] linearized
[00:18.80] level so if you recall in the previous
[00:22.32] lecture
[00:23.28] we introduced
[00:27.12] the following equation r a b
[00:30.48] minus a half r the richie scalar times g
[00:33.04] a b the metric
[00:34.40] is equal to eight pi t a b where t a b
[00:38.00] is the stress energy tensor
[00:40.72] so this is einstein's field equation or
[00:44.08] field equations as it's really a lot of
[00:46.16] equations all packaged into one little
[00:49.36] compact
[00:52.80] equation and in this lecture
[00:56.88] we're going to start investigating the
[00:59.28] general properties
[01:00.64] of this set of equations and also the
[01:04.16] how to solve them now it's pretty
[01:06.80] difficult to solve these equations it's
[01:08.80] non-trivial
[01:09.68] and we're going to work really hard and
[01:12.00] in fact it's going to occupy us pretty
[01:13.44] much for the rest of this course
[01:15.36] the the task of solving these equations
[01:17.28] in some very specific
[01:18.80] and restricted settings
[01:22.24] so it's pretty fair to say that
[01:25.52] solving einstein's field equations is
[01:27.36] still a bit of a research topic
[01:29.52] in more general settings
[01:33.76] okay let's start with some basic
[01:38.84] properties
[01:40.40] of these of this uh equation of motion
[01:43.36] for space time
[01:45.20] basic properties what are some basic
[01:47.12] things that we can do with these
[01:48.32] equations and some basic
[01:49.76] consequences we can derive well we can
[01:55.28] you know a good a good thing to do
[01:56.72] whenever you're faced with an equation
[01:58.40] of motion is just to start
[01:59.68] deriving other equations from it by
[02:02.24] operations that are allowed
[02:04.00] and that way you'll build up a bank or
[02:06.56] library
[02:07.28] of equations that are true
[02:10.80] given that your master equation of
[02:12.40] motion is true and then
[02:14.16] these may or may not be useful in
[02:15.60] various contexts so the first
[02:17.44] thing we're going to do is just apply
[02:19.52] some basic tensor operations
[02:21.12] to this to einstein's field equation see
[02:23.60] what kind of consequences we can draw
[02:25.52] from basic uh basic tensor operations
[02:29.60] so the first what's the first basic
[02:32.08] tensor operation you can take when you
[02:33.52] have a tensors
[02:34.40] so on the left hands if you look at
[02:35.76] einstein's field equations what do we
[02:36.88] have we have on the left hand side we
[02:38.08] have a rank two tensor on the right hand
[02:39.36] side we have the rank two tensor
[02:41.12] when you have a rank two ten so you can
[02:42.48] always take the trace contract it with a
[02:44.48] metric
[02:45.82] [Music]
[02:47.92] and that's a legal operation and what do
[02:50.88] you get
[02:52.08] well when you trace with by contracting
[02:55.04] with a metric
[02:56.64] we obtain an equation now
[03:00.32] which relates the richie scalar r and
[03:04.32] the trace of the stress energy tensor
[03:08.88] so that's a simple consequence of
[03:10.88] einstein's field equations
[03:13.44] so t is this the trace
[03:21.60] of the stress energy tensor
[03:24.80] okay and we can um substitute this
[03:27.84] equation now
[03:30.72] back into uh
[03:36.32] into einstein's field equation so now
[03:37.84] we're just sort of manipulating
[03:39.76] einstein's field equations and what do
[03:42.08] we obtain
[03:44.56] well you know we obtain the following
[03:46.80] equation so wherever you saw
[03:48.40] the richie scala before you can replace
[03:50.32] that with minus a pi
[03:51.52] t and so on the left-hand side you've
[03:53.68] got the
[03:54.64] the richie tensor and on the right-hand
[03:57.04] side you have only things
[03:59.28] nearly only things that depend on the
[04:01.84] stress energy tensor
[04:05.76] so this this second equation i've just
[04:07.52] derived here
[04:09.36] is well it looks very much like but
[04:13.52] you know there'll be lots of warnings
[04:16.96] about this as we go through the course
[04:18.88] it looks very much like the right hand
[04:20.96] side is just
[04:22.64] matter stuff or you know energy
[04:27.44] matter butter energy matter stress
[04:31.20] etc and on the left hand side there's
[04:34.48] geometry
[04:37.44] right the geometry is dictated or
[04:39.52] governed by rab
[04:41.20] and on the right hand side we've just
[04:42.32] got matter but we haven't really just
[04:43.84] got right hand side on the
[04:45.28] matter on the right hand side we've also
[04:46.72] got geometry
[04:48.32] in the form of the metric at least
[04:49.76] explicitly here and indeed implicitly in
[04:52.40] the structure of the
[04:53.44] stress energy tensor so you can't really
[04:55.76] disentangle
[04:56.96] um how the geometry is encoded in
[05:00.32] einstein's field equations
[05:02.08] from how the stress energy and matter
[05:04.32] energy density and so on is
[05:06.16] using is encoded in einstein's field
[05:08.40] equations so there's a i'll say more
[05:10.48] about this
[05:11.28] later so although this
[05:14.48] superficially looks like we've just
[05:16.32] written an equation where the geometry
[05:18.64] is totally determined by the stress
[05:20.00] energy
[05:21.20] the information is always flowing
[05:22.48] backwards and forwards in einstein's
[05:24.16] field equations
[05:27.76] but sometimes sometimes
[05:33.04] this equation
[05:38.96] can uh yield solutions so thinking
[05:46.40] you know this this formulation of
[05:47.60] einstein's field equations could
[05:48.72] sometimes yield solutions to
[05:52.88] for cases of specific cases of extreme
[05:55.12] symbols of symmetry
[05:59.76] okay so now we should
[06:01.24] [Music]
[06:05.20] examine some limits you know the next
[06:07.84] task
[06:09.84] in in studying the properties of
[06:12.48] einstein's field equations
[06:14.48] is to uh well
[06:19.04] solve it but before we even do that we
[06:20.88] should really convince ourselves that we
[06:22.48] do indeed
[06:23.12] recover the physics we know
[06:30.40] in the limits where we our current rules
[06:34.40] where the previous laws of physics apply
[06:40.72] so do we do we actually recover for
[06:43.76] example special relativity
[06:46.24] and
[06:50.80] newtonian physics
[06:54.08] as solutions
[06:57.44] to star in some limits
[07:04.00] you know in the limits where c goes to
[07:06.24] infinity or big g goes to zero
[07:08.96] uh do we actually recover
[07:12.00] these kind of uh domains of physics
[07:16.16] to the the solutions to einstein's field
[07:18.16] equations reduced to a good level of
[07:20.24] approximation
[07:21.84] to being describable by special
[07:24.56] relativity newtonian physics
[07:26.08] that's not clear at this point although
[07:28.48] we obtained einstein's field equations
[07:31.04] in a kind of viral kind of limiting
[07:32.64] argument you've written down some
[07:34.24] and we wrote down some equations of
[07:35.52] motion that doesn't mean that the actual
[07:36.80] solutions to these equations even exist
[07:39.04] let alone limit to the cases where we we
[07:42.24] expect them to be reducing to special
[07:44.96] relativity or newtonian physics
[07:46.80] so that's our goal for the next couple
[07:48.72] of lectures
[08:02.16] and our goal is to argue
[08:05.52] that gr reduces to sr
[08:13.68] or newtonian physics in
[08:18.16] the non
[08:23.68] i'll just say in the correct limits
[08:25.12] because already
[08:27.36] discussing what we mean by a limit will
[08:30.08] be slightly complicated
[08:32.88] and we'll clarify this later
[08:37.60] let's start by looking at some of the
[08:42.88] consequences of various limits so
[08:49.20] one of the simplest limits that we can
[08:50.72] investigate is the case where the energy
[08:53.20] of matter
[09:02.48] as measured by an observer at rest
[09:11.44] and i have to put scarecrows around that
[09:18.08] with respect to the whatever the
[09:20.88] heavenly body or masses
[09:24.80] or dust or whatever
[09:49.12] so in this limit where if you're an
[09:51.84] observer at rest with
[09:53.12] the masses in your uh
[09:56.48] determining the gravitational field in
[09:57.76] your system if you're an observer at
[09:59.36] rest with these masses
[10:00.48] and then the distribution of energy and
[10:02.72] stress energy
[10:03.60] is such that the masses
[10:06.64] dominate the stress energy tensor and
[10:08.96] the stresses are
[10:09.76] you can neglect them then
[10:12.96] in that limit t the trace of the stress
[10:15.76] energy tensor is minus rho
[10:18.16] which is also minus tab
[10:21.44] times va vb
[10:26.16] and we can substitute
[10:30.40] that into our various formulations
[10:34.00] of einstein's field equations and then
[10:35.92] we obtain
[10:39.28] the following equation
[10:48.96] so in this particular case you can see
[10:52.00] that
[10:54.16] the geometry is directly determined by
[10:56.96] the distribution of stress energy
[10:58.88] however a warning is that this will not
[11:01.28] always be
[11:01.92] the case
[11:10.16] now that we've got einstein's field
[11:11.84] equations in hand
[11:13.44] it's probably pertinent to summarize the
[11:15.68] physical content of gr
[11:17.52] as it is in our course at the current
[11:19.44] point
[11:26.08] before moving on
[11:33.76] so what is the physical content of gr
[11:35.52] well firstly there's the fundamental
[11:37.44] assumption
[11:40.32] of general relativity plus now we've
[11:43.36] been able to
[11:44.88] write down an equation
[11:49.52] capturing the last component of the
[11:52.24] fundamental
[11:53.76] assumption of general relativity
[11:56.88] so space time m the physical content of
[11:59.12] gr is just the following right space
[12:00.80] time m is a manifold with lorenzi and
[12:02.80] metric
[12:04.00] that's an assumption
[12:11.68] and the curvature of this metric the
[12:14.16] curvature of
[12:15.84] gab is related
[12:21.68] to the matter distribution
[12:26.96] stress energy distribution
[12:30.88] in space time
[12:35.28] via einstein's field equation star okay
[12:37.84] so that's the fundamental assumption
[12:41.28] as it currently stands in our course
[12:44.72] of general relativity
[12:48.48] and
[12:51.60] even in the manipulations we just the
[12:53.36] elementary manipulations we've just done
[12:55.12] involving einstein's field equations a
[12:57.12] couple of things should really be
[12:58.48] apparent
[12:59.44] a couple of comments should be made
[13:02.48] that that
[13:06.16] highlight or bring out certain aspects
[13:09.04] of einstein's field equation and general
[13:10.72] relativity
[13:11.92] and these these comments have to be made
[13:13.92] at this point in the course
[13:15.68] to prevent you from drawing
[13:19.04] too strong an analogy between general
[13:21.28] relativity and
[13:22.88] electrodynamics for example and other
[13:25.84] fields of physics
[13:27.04] so the first comment that's really
[13:29.84] fundamental
[13:30.56] and you can't get rid of it is that the
[13:32.72] einstein's field equation
[13:34.00] isn't is not linear right it's not only
[13:36.56] not linear it's highly non-linear
[13:38.48] it's one of the most nonlinear sets of
[13:41.28] equations
[13:42.96] that we have in physics
[13:48.16] it's a highly non-linear system of
[13:50.40] coupled
[13:51.28] partial differential equations
[14:00.00] involving the metric
[14:06.64] when you go to some coordinate system
[14:09.20] obviously
[14:15.44] it it and it's further it's not not
[14:17.60] first order like maybe
[14:19.76] the order of the the derivative might be
[14:21.52] low and save you
[14:23.36] and allow you to to use some
[14:25.28] computational tricks from
[14:26.80] not only partial differential equations
[14:28.48] but no it's even second order
[14:30.72] in derivatives so it's really it's
[14:33.04] fiendish
[14:34.72] set of equations and there's lots of
[14:36.80] them they're non-linear they're
[14:38.56] coupled and they're they're second order
[14:44.48] so that's the first comment to make it's
[14:46.00] really the one of the uh
[14:48.08] most challenging set of equations of
[14:49.84] motion that exists in physics i mean
[14:51.36] quantum mechanics is nothing in
[14:52.72] comparison to this right quantum
[14:54.00] mechanics is linear
[14:56.72] the difficulty in quantum mechanics is
[14:58.24] there's just so many dimensions
[15:00.16] of course it must be said at this point
[15:02.16] i won't write it down but it
[15:03.68] must be said that any nonlinear equation
[15:05.60] can be reduced to an infinite set of
[15:07.12] linear equations so
[15:08.16] arguably the difficulty in quantum
[15:09.76] mechanics and general relativity
[15:11.76] is not not uh income
[15:14.96] incomparable uh
[15:18.24] the second comment and i alluded to this
[15:20.32] earlier today is that unlike
[15:22.16] for example in electrodynamics with
[15:25.12] maxwell's equations
[15:31.60] we cannot regard the stress energy
[15:33.52] tensor simply as a source
[15:40.96] you know in maxwell's equations you have
[15:42.64] the current for current
[15:44.16] and you can regard that just simply as a
[15:45.68] source you specify the current and then
[15:47.68] the electro
[15:48.24] electromagnetic field is just completely
[15:49.84] determined
[15:52.48] by the current you know the distribution
[15:54.56] of charge and current
[15:57.52] uh so we can't regard however in general
[16:00.64] relativity
[16:03.36] as a source that's somehow independently
[16:06.00] causing
[16:06.80] causating the the gravitational field
[16:10.96] and met therefore metric
[16:16.80] this is really fundamental uh
[16:20.24] fundamental aspect of general relativity
[16:22.08] that maxwell's equations simply doesn't
[16:23.76] have
[16:25.52] and the reason is
[16:30.16] just defining the stress energy tensor
[16:34.96] involves the metric
[16:40.56] certainly in the examples that are
[16:42.16] relevant in in cosmology
[16:44.24] and in other
[16:47.36] in even the electromagnetic field for
[16:50.16] example
[16:52.40] so the the reason the naive reason and
[16:54.96] really the fundamental reason also that
[16:56.64] you can't
[16:57.76] regard tab as a source is that tab the
[17:00.00] stress energy tensor itself is defined
[17:02.16] in terms of the metric
[17:07.36] for most physical systems that we're
[17:10.88] going to be interested in
[17:12.08] in particular perfect fluids
[17:15.76] so we can't even interpret
[17:26.96] the stress energy tensor before solving
[17:33.36] einstein's field equation you have to
[17:34.56] solve for everything all at once
[17:36.44] self-consistently self-consistently
[17:43.28] and the third one third comment
[17:46.64] uh that that we have to make about
[17:48.24] einstein's field equations and this is
[17:49.68] you know this is this is the stuff of
[17:54.56] of magic and
[17:58.64] an or
[18:02.24] and that is that einstein's field
[18:04.00] equations
[18:06.72] are amazingly self-consistent in a way
[18:09.68] that's
[18:10.48] incredibly difficult to engineer
[18:13.68] and that is uh and i'll explain what i
[18:16.40] mean
[18:16.72] so i transferred equations implies this
[18:19.28] divergence condition on the stress
[18:20.80] energy tensor right that's
[18:22.40] in fact how we how i argued in the
[18:24.88] previous lecture
[18:28.48] the the the modification of the
[18:31.76] ritchie tensor to the einstein's tensor
[18:33.92] that's one way to introduce it
[18:36.40] and so now okay so what right
[18:39.52] but the the interesting thing about this
[18:42.48] equation is that it may be argued
[18:44.80] that this equation
[18:48.00] actually implies something else right
[18:53.12] it implies and this is the magic that
[18:55.68] for a dust
[18:56.64] right of grains
[19:01.20] and by that you should sort of think of
[19:02.88] test bodies
[19:06.72] so for a dust of grains exerting no
[19:08.64] force on each other so in the limit
[19:10.16] where you've got these little test
[19:11.28] masses like a dust in space time
[19:19.84] this equation implies
[19:26.80] that the grains of sand or dust or
[19:29.44] whatever
[19:30.96] move on geodesics
[19:39.52] so effectively einstein's field
[19:43.04] equations
[19:44.80] contain the geodesic hypothesis already
[19:53.12] so i began the our discussion of general
[19:56.24] relativity by saying that it's a
[19:57.60] hypothesis that that
[19:59.20] obs observers freely pulling test masses
[20:01.28] move on on geodesics
[20:04.84] but the equation and then
[20:08.64] you know by its various argumentation
[20:10.64] strategies we got to uh einstein's field
[20:12.72] equations but now einstein's field
[20:13.92] equations themselves contain
[20:16.00] effectively the geodesic hypothesis that
[20:18.32] freely falling masses move on
[20:20.00] geodesics of the sp of the of the
[20:22.08] space-time metric
[20:23.52] and now that's an extraordinary piece of
[20:25.92] self-consistency that comes out of the
[20:28.16] uh out of einstein's field equations and
[20:31.04] this kind of thing
[20:32.32] is what really convinces you that that
[20:35.12] there must be something right about
[20:36.56] general relativity usually
[20:38.56] if you try to to write down equations of
[20:40.96] motion for
[20:41.68] complex systems usually you can write
[20:44.40] something down pretty easy but then
[20:46.80] the minute you check it for
[20:48.32] self-consistency with other assumptions
[20:50.00] that may or may not be built directly
[20:51.52] into the equations of motion you find
[20:52.96] that things aren't consistent
[20:55.60] so that's an amazing consequence of
[20:57.84] einstein's field equations that
[20:59.84] they effectively contain the geodesic
[21:01.68] hypothesis without that being directly
[21:03.28] built into them
[21:05.12] and you know that alone is is
[21:07.52] breathtakingly
[21:08.64] impressive and something that
[21:12.32] is sort of difficult to comprehend even
[21:14.64] how that came about
[21:16.48] because it's it's you know this
[21:17.92] magically wants to be correct this
[21:19.92] theory
[21:24.56] okay so with these comments in hand
[21:26.64] let's get to the business in the rest of
[21:28.40] the course
[21:29.76] of uh solving einstein's field equation
[21:32.32] this is something we should get to now
[21:34.72] and we won't get away from like this is
[21:36.40] it we're going to be spending the rest
[21:37.76] of this course
[21:39.52] solving star trying to and probably
[21:42.40] failing most of the time
[21:46.48] of course we're not going to completely
[21:48.40] fail i'm going to present to you some
[21:50.00] idealized solutions
[21:51.36] but solving einstein's field equations
[21:53.68] in the realistic
[21:54.80] situation of the initial conditions of
[21:56.48] our universe is incredibly difficult
[22:00.56] we can only approach its solution
[22:04.16] via various limits and the first
[22:08.80] limit that we're going to investigate is
[22:10.08] the limit where gravity is weak
[22:12.64] and i'll explain what i mean by that um
[22:15.20] there are other limits where we'll
[22:16.40] investigate the solutions of einstein's
[22:17.84] field equations and we'll be able to get
[22:19.36] a solution that's in the cases of high
[22:22.08] high degrees of symmetry in
[22:23.52] in these in the system so we're going to
[22:25.36] be able to solve i transferred equations
[22:27.12] in this situation where the universe is
[22:29.12] completely rotationally symmetric
[22:31.20] it's not very physical but hey um
[22:34.48] that'll get us actually close to an
[22:36.64] interesting situation
[22:38.80] to model heavenly bodies and we'll also
[22:41.12] investigate the solution of einstein's
[22:42.40] field equations in the cosmological
[22:44.00] setting
[22:45.68] where the distribution of matter is
[22:47.44] uniform so none of these limits are
[22:49.84] directly physical
[22:50.96] it has to be said but each of the
[22:54.16] solutions that we're going to
[22:55.04] investigate in this course will give us
[22:56.56] indirect information about how
[22:58.24] einstein's field of
[22:59.36] general solutions of insurance field
[23:00.64] equations behave
[23:03.28] but let's not get ahead of ourselves
[23:04.56] we're going to try and solve and it will
[23:06.56] take us a couple of lectures to do so
[23:10.80] uh we're going to try and solve
[23:11.92] einstein's field equations in the case
[23:13.36] where gravity is weak
[23:14.80] very close to special special relativity
[23:30.00] now even this deserves scare quotes like
[23:31.76] what does it mean weak
[23:38.64] and for us what it's going to mean is
[23:41.12] that the space time metric
[23:44.56] that's the thing we're solving for the
[23:47.20] space time metric
[23:50.08] be somehow close to flat
[24:11.44] and for us that's going to entail an
[24:13.44] assumption namely that the space-time
[24:15.36] metric is somehow
[24:20.24] the space diametric is somehow
[24:23.60] equal to the flat magic of minkowski
[24:25.60] space time plus a bit
[24:27.52] small perturbation
[24:39.20] and this small perturbation
[24:42.64] is going to have to be small whatever
[24:44.48] that means
[24:47.84] now in this uh coordinate free notation
[24:50.72] that we've adopted
[24:51.92] uh here in this to describe the the
[24:55.04] space symmetric g
[24:56.72] uh smallness or bigness there's no
[24:58.32] meaning yet we haven't actually
[25:00.40] uh you know you have to say small with
[25:02.40] respect to something
[25:04.08] um and actually it's a bit tricky to
[25:06.56] define this notion
[25:08.00] in the coordinate free way and we're not
[25:10.16] going to define it in a coordinate free
[25:11.76] way the only way i'm going to
[25:14.96] to argue that gamma a b is small
[25:18.72] is that um
[25:22.88] in a given coordinate system in a
[25:25.04] particular coordinate system so we're
[25:26.64] going to appeal to a certain coordinate
[25:28.16] system here and we're going to thereby
[25:29.84] break the coordinate in variance of our
[25:32.40] equations
[25:34.96] we're going to say that in a specific
[25:36.16] coordinate system the components of
[25:37.92] gamma a b
[25:38.72] are the components cannot be as small
[26:13.44] so here here now we'll be a bit more
[26:15.52] specific about what we mean by smallness
[26:17.12] we say that
[26:18.16] um gamma a b is small if there exists a
[26:20.80] global coordinate system
[26:22.84] global
[26:28.88] and i should probably say inertial
[26:30.48] coordinate system
[26:38.00] note the word global as well here
[26:41.92] um
[26:47.04] such that the coordinate the components
[26:48.96] of the the perturbation gamma
[26:51.28] mu nu in this global inertial coordinate
[26:53.20] system
[26:55.52] small with respect to
[26:59.36] one let's see
[27:03.84] so just to stress this again before we
[27:06.80] choose a coordinate system
[27:08.80] we can't say what gamma a b small means
[27:12.24] gamma a b is just an abstract box
[27:16.32] you need a criteria for specifying when
[27:18.40] gamma a b is small or large
[27:21.12] and the criteria that we select when
[27:22.96] discussing linearized
[27:24.40] gravity is to go to a global inertial
[27:26.48] coordinate system you know the one where
[27:28.16] the flat metric is defined for example
[27:30.80] and then then you now we're in a
[27:32.40] coordinate system we can write out gamma
[27:34.08] a b in terms of its coordinate
[27:36.72] components in this coordinate system and
[27:38.24] those will become like numbers that
[27:39.68] depend on position
[27:41.52] space-time position and now those
[27:43.12] numbers you can look at those numbers
[27:44.40] and say are they small or big with
[27:46.16] respect to the the
[27:49.12] the dimensions of your the units of your
[27:52.40] system
[27:55.84] and now we can say a little bit better
[27:57.60] what we mean by linearized gravity
[28:02.32] what is it well it's it's what results
[28:07.84] from substituting
[28:13.36] star an indian monster from substituting
[28:18.24] g mu g a b let's say still right you
[28:21.12] know we understand what smallness means
[28:22.72] now so we're going to work back in our
[28:24.32] abstract notation as much as we can
[28:28.64] into star so that's what linearized
[28:31.28] gravity means
[28:34.56] uh and that's
[28:38.32] and collecting
[28:45.52] terms to first order
[28:49.52] in gamma a b
[28:54.80] so there's a couple of computational
[28:57.68] subtleties that we have to highlight
[28:59.12] when working in
[29:00.00] linearized gravity
[29:08.64] we should technically raise in lower
[29:11.44] indices with g
[29:12.64] right raising annoying is always done
[29:14.96] with respect to the metric g
[29:16.88] but we can get away with raising
[29:19.92] lowering with respect to eta a b because
[29:21.92] everything's small
[29:23.36] um and that works almost all the time
[29:26.48] there is one case where it doesn't work
[29:27.84] a little highlight that in the moment
[29:30.32] and uh yeah let's talk about that still
[29:33.92] um
[29:37.04] there is an exception so almost always
[29:40.16] you can raise in low indices with the
[29:41.68] flat metric because
[29:43.04] to that order in the to linear order
[29:46.08] the higher order corrections just won't
[29:47.76] matter however there is an exception
[29:50.64] uh g a b when you see g a b with indices
[29:53.92] upper that doesn't mean g
[29:55.68] raised with respect to eta but it
[29:58.32] actually denotes the true inverse
[30:07.04] uh to gab and
[30:10.96] not you know what it could be
[30:14.16] there's an interpretation or an
[30:16.00] alternate interpretation to what gab
[30:18.24] could mean it could mean right having
[30:20.24] raised it with respect to eta
[30:21.84] no we don't mean that whenever you see
[30:24.88] gab with their indices raised
[30:30.24] it means the actual inverse the gab and
[30:32.64] you can calculate
[30:35.28] as an exercise in fact it's not even an
[30:37.92] exercise i'll just do it
[30:39.60] um gab is to linear order just ada a b
[30:44.80] minus the metric uh
[30:48.56] don't believe me well let's check um
[30:54.32] let's multiply by contracting on the
[30:56.24] second index g
[30:57.60] a b upper with gac lower and i'm just
[31:00.80] going to collect terms
[31:01.84] the first order in gamma
[31:09.92] okay so that's everything to first order
[31:12.88] that you need to
[31:13.68] worry about and we're going to be able
[31:14.88] to neglect one term so the first
[31:17.36] the first thing we get is when we
[31:18.40] contract eta against itself and then we
[31:20.16] get a nice little delta function
[31:22.32] and then we contract gamma against eta
[31:28.24] and then we get this remember we're
[31:31.44] using upper and lower
[31:32.80] to mean contraction with respect to eta
[31:35.28] and then we have
[31:36.56] an additional gamma ac coming from the
[31:38.40] other contraction
[31:40.00] and then we have a second order term
[31:41.44] right i'm just going to write it out but
[31:42.56] we immediately neglect it because we're
[31:43.84] working the first order in gamma
[31:47.04] so that's gone and then these first
[31:49.36] order terms cancel
[31:51.04] and so we have to first order that the
[31:54.96] equation that i've written down for the
[31:56.48] inverse of g is is
[31:58.24] indeed the inverse now if you're a
[32:01.28] little bit uncomfortable about raising
[32:02.64] lowering with respect to a to a b
[32:04.00] then you can certainly raise and lower
[32:05.36] with respect to g you just have a whole
[32:07.20] bunch of extra terms that you'll have to
[32:08.48] worry about but at the end
[32:10.00] once you've done all the calculations
[32:12.00] you'll throw all those extra terms out
[32:13.60] and you realize
[32:14.24] oh yeah i could have just effectively
[32:16.72] raised and lowered with ada a b
[32:18.56] so depending on your paranoia level and
[32:20.64] your skepticism level
[32:22.00] of this statement you're invited to go
[32:24.24] through this derivation by raising and
[32:25.84] lowering with respect to the entire
[32:27.20] metric but i claim at the end you'll get
[32:29.04] the same result as if you just raised in
[32:30.80] lord with respect to the flat metric
[32:34.56] all right so now we're in a global
[32:36.08] coordinate system
[32:40.96] or we will uh eventually appeal
[32:44.96] to a global coordinate system but
[32:48.08] we assume already at this stage there is
[32:50.08] a global coordinate system
[32:52.16] you know this is not a fundamental
[32:53.44] assumption of gr that there is a global
[32:55.04] coordinate system
[32:56.24] describing your whole space time indeed
[32:58.56] it's completely open
[33:00.08] uh if our space time is covered by a
[33:03.12] global coordinate patch it seems
[33:06.32] unlikely with the current experimental
[33:08.84] evidence
[33:10.16] but if you assume that space time can be
[33:12.24] covered by a global coordinate system
[33:14.56] and that the metric gamma g is
[33:17.84] almost eta plus some small components in
[33:20.64] gamma
[33:22.00] then you can start to calculate the
[33:23.92] stuff we need to calculate to write down
[33:25.76] eight science field equations
[33:29.04] and the first thing we're going to need
[33:30.32] is the covariant derivative
[33:34.32] and to write down the covariance
[33:35.60] derivative we're going to need
[33:37.44] the crystal symbols all right so here we
[33:39.84] go let's do it
[33:41.04] crystal symbols c a b how are they
[33:43.84] defined well
[33:45.12] remember there's a g c d
[33:51.36] and then there's a whole bunch of
[33:52.72] derivatives d a
[33:54.72] g b d plus
[33:58.08] d b g a d minus
[34:01.44] d d g a b okay that's that's the crystal
[34:05.76] symbols but we're working to linear
[34:07.12] order and gamma now and now a lot of
[34:08.56] these things can just cancel out so
[34:10.16] first of all
[34:11.04] and i'll just do these these
[34:12.16] substitutions in place
[34:14.08] uh the final notes won't have this this
[34:16.72] equation there but you can see them
[34:18.80] evolve as we talk so what's gbd right
[34:21.76] well you had an equation for that gbd
[34:23.76] is that's the fundamental assumption of
[34:26.32] linear
[34:27.84] linearized gravity it's the flat metric
[34:29.52] plus the perturbation so we can erase
[34:32.08] g and i'll just do that right now like
[34:35.12] uh we get a to b d plus
[34:38.64] gamma b d right that's what g is
[34:42.16] but the derivative of the flat metric is
[34:43.84] zero because it's
[34:45.20] just a constant so actually
[34:48.48] to linear order g vanishes
[34:52.32] and we just get gammas instead
[34:59.44] that was easy right we just got rid of
[35:03.20] a bunch of terms there could potentially
[35:07.04] have been
[35:07.68] you know six terms in the brackets here
[35:09.36] and it's actually only three thankfully
[35:11.20] and now we've also got the inverse of
[35:12.80] the metric right so but i told you how
[35:14.32] we're going to compute the inverse of
[35:15.52] the metric
[35:16.64] that's going to be computed as eta a b
[35:19.36] minus
[35:19.92] gamma oops e to c d minus gamma c
[35:23.44] d now already
[35:28.16] we we get to throw away some terms
[35:29.84] because the stuff to the right here
[35:33.92] oops
[35:40.64] one node crashed okay the stuff to the
[35:43.12] right here
[35:48.32] just check the recording is working the
[35:50.96] stuff to the right here
[35:53.84] is already at linear order in gamma and
[35:56.48] so if you multiply anything linear
[35:58.00] ordering gamma by something
[35:59.52] linear ordering gamma namely gamma
[36:01.12] itself then you you you get
[36:02.88] zero to order linear order and gamma so
[36:04.64] actually
[36:05.92] we can compute the christopher symbols
[36:08.80] you know
[36:12.00] uh somewhat easily well less horribly
[36:15.68] than maybe
[36:16.40] could have been the case
[36:19.60] and so now we've got an equation for the
[36:22.16] crystal symbols right we can just dump
[36:25.60] uh dump this this equation
[36:29.36] that are in red that i've struck out to
[36:31.52] zero and we're left with
[36:33.52] uh a somewhat simpler expression for the
[36:35.92] chris double symbols
[36:38.48] and that now once you've got the crystal
[36:40.24] symbols you can just go straight ahead
[36:42.24] and uh compute the richie tensor
[36:47.60] if you remember when i introduced the
[36:49.12] ritchie tensor
[36:50.72] there's a way to compute it in terms of
[36:53.44] the riemann tensor
[36:54.88] and in our case the riemann tensor is
[36:56.56] just some expressions involving
[36:58.80] the richie derivatives of the crystal
[37:01.44] symbols and
[37:02.64] quadratic expressions in terms of the
[37:04.48] christopher symbols
[37:10.40] so this is an exercise for you
[37:14.00] and the claim is to linear order
[37:20.08] the ritchie tenses actually you can find
[37:22.48] it via
[37:23.36] this equation here already you remember
[37:27.28] you know you you would usually have some
[37:28.96] terms involving the crystals quadratic
[37:30.88] expressions of the crystal symbols but
[37:32.32] they all vanish
[37:33.28] to linear order right because
[37:34.64] everything's already uh to linear order
[37:37.12] and so if you square them then you've
[37:38.32] got to get zero
[37:41.36] so there's the richie tensor and
[37:45.20] we can now substitute for the expression
[37:47.12] that we have obtained
[37:48.40] for the christopher symbols just above
[37:50.40] to linear order
[37:51.68] and then we get c and then there's some
[37:56.16] symmetrized terms
[38:06.32] oopsies
[38:12.16] where i've introduced the trace of gamma
[38:15.76] gamma is defined to be the trace of
[38:17.68] gamma
[38:19.52] now that we've got the ritchie tensor in
[38:21.04] hand we can
[38:22.64] write out the einstein tensor g a b to
[38:25.44] first order
[38:26.96] and the way g a b is defined will you
[38:29.20] take the rigid tensor
[38:30.56] and you subtract from it a half by the
[38:32.32] metric multiplied by the richie scala
[38:35.44] now to this level to this order uh we
[38:38.40] can regard them
[38:39.28] the metric simply as a linear term
[38:42.24] because the other term
[38:43.52] multiplied by the rigid scale is already
[38:44.96] zero to linear order
[38:46.56] and we obtain the following lengthy
[38:48.40] expression
[38:50.72] for the einstein tensor
[39:02.24] things will simplify later but at this
[39:05.36] point
[39:07.44] this is what the einstein tensor looks
[39:12.84] like
[39:27.04] we can make it things look
[39:30.32] slightly bit more compact
[39:37.92] by defining a new quantity gamma bar
[39:41.60] the perturbation as being minus a half
[39:44.80] as gamma a b minus a half a to a b times
[39:47.68] by gamma
[39:49.04] and then
[39:52.64] then star the einstein's field equations
[39:54.80] to linear order
[40:05.36] einstein's field equations now can be
[40:07.44] written out
[40:09.12] in their full glory and here they are to
[40:11.76] linear order
[40:33.20] this is just an exercise in rewriting
[40:35.04] some equations
[40:36.72] for uh and the right hand side is just
[40:39.12] the full
[40:40.56] stress energy tensor so this is this is
[40:43.52] what the einstein field equations look
[40:45.12] like to linear order
[40:48.96] we haven't done anything particularly
[40:50.16] intelligent yet we just substituted
[40:54.00] our expansion for the metric
[40:59.12] into einstein's field equations
[41:01.28] collected terms to linear order in gamma
[41:03.44] and written out what we've got now this
[41:06.56] equation is not super friendly to look
[41:08.40] at actually have i missed the term one
[41:10.40] two three
[41:12.08] no that's correct i believe this this
[41:14.32] equation is not super friendly to look
[41:15.84] at i mean it is linear
[41:17.12] it's linear in gamma right
[41:23.12] and so at least we have a chance of
[41:24.40] solving it
[41:27.12] when something's linear uh it's a linear
[41:29.20] pde of second order
[41:30.88] in gamma and so we can go ahead and
[41:32.40] solve this set of 16 linear pde
[41:35.12] but you know you want to work smart when
[41:36.88] you can and
[41:38.56] we're going to do that now we're going
[41:40.16] to dive take a digression for the next
[41:42.32] lecture or two
[41:43.44] to actually identify the symmetries of
[41:46.80] this equation so that we can simplify it
[41:48.80] somewhat it'll make just
[41:49.92] our lives easier and uh so we're going
[41:52.88] to make a little bit extra investment of
[41:54.64] energy
[41:55.12] now in understanding the symmetries of
[41:57.76] this equation
[41:58.96] so that we can find find spend that
[42:02.40] symmetry to write down a simpler
[42:04.16] equivalent equation for gamma and that
[42:06.72] equation will be so
[42:07.76] simple that we'll be able to solve it
[42:09.20] really easily
[42:11.52] so that's our task now this equation
[42:16.56] you can actually simplify it
[42:26.24] and the way you simplify it is to use
[42:27.84] the gauge freedom
[42:29.60] so-called gauge freedom
[42:35.12] of general relativity so general
[42:38.32] relativity the formulation that we
[42:40.96] that we're describing here of general
[42:42.32] relativity has a symmetry
[42:45.92] and i'm going to explain that symmetry
[42:47.60] over the coming lectures
[42:49.12] and it is this that if you have
[42:54.32] a diffumorphism phi of your space-time
[42:57.76] manifold
[42:58.40] m then uh
[43:09.20] then the two uh metrics
[43:12.72] namely your original one that solves
[43:14.56] einstein's field equations
[43:18.48] and the metric you get from doing the
[43:21.28] diphymorphism
[43:25.68] we'll call it get gab prime for the
[43:27.68] moment i'll explain how to calculate gab
[43:30.64] prime they represent the same space-time
[43:38.84] geometry now i'm going to explain all of
[43:40.96] this
[43:45.04] but to do that we're going to have to
[43:46.32] spend a little bit more time
[43:48.32] on some foundational aspects of
[43:51.28] differential geometry
[44:07.60] okay so we're going to take a little
[44:09.28] digression
[44:14.00] to talk about maps of manifolds
[44:24.00] so uh let's suppose
[44:29.68] that we have two manifolds let's say m
[44:32.48] and
[44:34.84] n
[44:38.16] they're they're arbitrary but m and n
[44:43.28] and let let's also suppose we have some
[44:46.32] map between these two manifolds let's
[44:48.56] let phi m n
[44:50.40] be a smooth map
[44:54.72] from m to n then
[44:58.40] the first thing to note
[45:01.52] is that associated to any function
[45:08.96] on our target manifold n given any such
[45:12.48] any arbitrary function on n is actually
[45:15.20] implicitly
[45:16.32] via phi a function on m
[45:26.24] circle pullback function
[45:33.44] composed with phi and if you check how
[45:36.40] where the arrows go everything works out
[45:38.08] right so here's
[45:39.28] you know this is the manifold m then we
[45:42.32] have the map phi
[45:43.52] from m to some other manifold n
[45:46.72] and then you've got to map f to the real
[45:50.08] numbers
[45:52.32] and then just by doing one than the
[45:54.40] other
[45:56.08] you automatically obtain
[46:00.00] function that goes from m
[46:03.04] to r and this function has a name it's
[46:05.84] called the pullback function
[46:07.92] now it doesn't stop there it the minute
[46:10.56] you
[46:10.96] you write down a map between two
[46:13.36] manifolds then you can start
[46:14.96] uh pulling back various geometrical
[46:16.96] quantities from one manifold to the
[46:18.40] other and pushing forward other ones so
[46:20.08] let's
[46:20.80] talk about you know what kind of
[46:22.08] geometrical quantities am i talking
[46:23.44] about
[46:24.08] well you know the first associated
[46:26.16] quantity you can put on a manifold after
[46:27.84] functions
[46:28.48] is tangent vectors so what happens to a
[46:31.44] tangent vector
[46:32.32] well if you have a tangent vector
[46:39.84] you suppose you have a tangent vector
[46:41.20] some point p in m
[46:45.68] there is a uh you can actually build in
[46:48.64] a canonical canonical meaning standard
[46:51.60] there is a circle push forward
[47:05.84] that you can define canonically on n
[47:12.80] and the way you obtain this push forward
[47:14.32] vector is we set up first a linear map
[47:16.80] phi star that takes the tangent space at
[47:19.28] some point p
[47:20.16] in a manifold to a tangent space
[47:25.44] defined at the image of this point so
[47:27.36] this is the point p and under phi we
[47:29.28] have another point p
[47:30.72] phi of p here and we obviously
[47:34.64] will eventually get a image of the
[47:36.80] tangent vector at p
[47:40.96] and uh
[47:44.32] how does this linear map work
[47:51.28] well phi star is defined as follows
[47:55.52] so for some tangent vector at a point p
[47:59.04] on the manifold m we're going to define
[48:04.88] a new tangent vector phi star v which
[48:07.76] lives at
[48:09.12] the corresponding point phi p in the
[48:11.60] manifold n
[48:13.36] by
[48:16.40] this formula here phi star v when
[48:19.60] evaluated on a function
[48:21.20] f is just to be fine to be v
[48:24.72] evaluated on f compose phi
[48:30.24] you should you should think about this
[48:32.00] for a bit
[48:39.36] you know there's a couple of properties
[48:40.48] that you need to check that this this
[48:42.08] this uh
[48:42.80] definition is coherent with you know do
[48:45.20] you get a tangent vector
[48:46.80] is it linear does it obey leibniz and so
[48:50.48] on
[48:53.52] and that's got to be true for all smooth
[48:56.08] functions
[48:57.68] on m so we get a tangent vector
[49:03.84] by this prescription here and this is
[49:06.00] called the
[49:07.20] push forward of the tangent vector
[49:14.84] v
[49:23.92] now it turns out
[49:27.52] the map if i start is familiar to you
[49:33.68] it's the jacobian
[49:44.32] if we choose
[49:48.64] a coordinate system so if x mu denote
[49:51.68] coordinates of uh
[49:56.84] m
[49:58.16] and respectively y nu
[50:01.60] is the coordinates of n
[50:05.92] then the matrix
[50:09.04] because now you know phi star is a map
[50:11.60] of linear vector space
[50:12.80] is a linear map of vector spaces by v p
[50:14.96] to v phi p so you can write it out
[50:16.96] as a matrix in terms of the basis of
[50:20.32] both of these
[50:21.28] vector spaces so and that basis is
[50:23.76] furnished by the standard derivatives
[50:26.08] with respect to these coordinates so the
[50:27.76] matrix of components of phi star
[50:29.68] is then
[50:34.96] so this you can now regard it as a
[50:37.20] matrix and you can work out its
[50:38.40] components and this is an exercise for
[50:40.16] you to just confirm this
[50:41.92] is d y mu
[50:45.12] d x nu so phi star is the
[50:49.12] jacobian if you like of
[50:52.84] um the map
[50:55.76] phi
[50:58.80] now similarly right this is now we've
[51:00.96] got it for vectors we can immediately
[51:02.64] start deducing things for covectors or
[51:04.80] dual vectors by the same argument so we
[51:09.20] can pull back
[51:11.92] our joule vectors
[51:18.00] at phi p
[51:25.84] by defining
[51:30.16] the following linear map going from dual
[51:33.12] vector spaces v p
[51:34.64] v phi v5p star to vb star
[51:53.76] and how do we define v phi star well
[51:56.56] give it a dual vector
[51:57.68] mu and then demand
[52:01.68] that when we contract it with a tangent
[52:03.60] vector v that's the same as
[52:05.44] applying the joule vector
[52:08.48] to phi star v contracted against mu
[52:18.32] so that's how you can immediately extend
[52:20.72] you know the minute you have something
[52:22.00] that maps
[52:22.88] tangent vectors the tangent some tangent
[52:24.72] vectors in one vector space to attach
[52:26.24] vectors and another vector space and you
[52:27.60] you
[52:28.16] pretty much have something that that'll
[52:30.32] hold dually for the jewel vectors
[52:34.00] and we can extend this
[52:38.40] now
[52:41.44] to even tenses
[52:45.60] of type t not l
[52:58.24] by defining phi star
[53:01.44] of a tensor the components of the of a
[53:04.08] tensor
[53:07.52] by demanding that these components phi
[53:09.36] star of t
[53:11.12] obey the following equation here
[53:14.80] and this is just the generalization of
[53:17.44] the push forward equation that we've
[53:19.04] already seen
[53:26.40] sorry the pullback equation and
[53:29.84] to uh tenses of type k naught
[53:34.24] we also have a similar uh
[53:38.72] push forward type expression
[54:03.60] this is what you get it's essentially
[54:06.56] natural
[54:07.76] there's no way a you would have a hard
[54:10.64] time arguing
[54:11.44] that this is not the right way to to do
[54:13.44] things
[54:14.88] so this is for all v1 through to vl and
[54:17.68] for all
[54:18.40] mu 1 through the mu k
[54:23.12] so once you've got a map between two
[54:24.80] manifolds then very quickly
[54:26.64] you can build maps between tensor
[54:29.84] objects on these manifolds but note the
[54:31.92] directions of these arrows right
[54:36.00] so here's m here's n
[54:41.68] so phi star the push forward goes that
[54:43.84] direction but
[54:45.12] and takes tangent vectors forward but
[54:48.32] phi star lower goes the other direction
[54:51.44] let me just check that that's consistent
[54:52.80] with what i've been saying
[54:53.92] yes indeed it is so uh
[54:57.20] and that means that you know a tensor
[55:00.72] object which is
[55:03.84] acting on n and some tensor products of
[55:07.12] the dual vector space would a tensor
[55:08.64] object there gets taken
[55:09.68] back to m but a vector a a tensor on
[55:13.44] vector spaces
[55:15.28] or in tensor products of vector spaces
[55:17.52] tangent vector spaces gets pushed
[55:18.80] forward to n
[55:20.24] so there's no natural
[55:27.12] way to get an action
[55:31.20] of phi on mixed tenses
[55:42.40] because the arrows are going the wrong
[55:43.68] way right some of the components get
[55:45.12] transformed from
[55:46.24] mapped from n to m and some of the
[55:47.84] others we get from map from m to n
[55:57.20] yeah so we don't get an action on
[55:59.12] tensors of type kl
[56:00.80] there's no natural action on tensors of
[56:02.64] type kl because
[56:04.96] a tensor of type kl the various
[56:07.92] components will be pushed forward or
[56:09.68] pulled back depending if they're vector
[56:11.44] vectorial or dual vector
[56:14.00] but there is a way to get out of this
[56:19.44] uh if phi i mean so far phi is just some
[56:22.96] smooth map it doesn't have to be any
[56:24.72] particular smooth map
[56:26.00] however if pi is a diffumorphism then we
[56:28.48] we have a little bit more information
[56:30.80] that we can exploit
[56:38.80] and in particular that means that m the
[56:40.48] manifold m is now the manifold in
[56:43.20] so if phi is a diphymorphism we can
[56:46.24] exploit
[56:49.28] the fact that the inverse exists and is
[56:51.60] also smooth
[56:58.88] and we can extend this map that we've
[57:01.04] just defined above
[57:05.04] to apply to mixed tenses
[57:15.44] and this is because phi star oops if i
[57:19.28] inverse star
[57:22.08] is a linear map that goes from v phi p
[57:25.12] to v so now that takes vp that takes the
[57:27.60] vectors on
[57:28.40] the target manifold backwards
[57:32.48] and then we define in this particular
[57:35.68] case
[57:36.64] a full action of phi on on a mixed
[57:40.08] tensor and how do we do it well
[57:42.16] we just combine the two actions that we
[57:44.32] introduced above
[58:06.84] here
[58:16.72] so we take these actions of phi star on
[58:19.52] the individual joule vectors and vectors
[58:21.92] and
[58:24.88] we apply them to the inverses now
[58:28.88] of phi also in order to get a map that
[58:31.20] goes the correct way
[58:38.96] and that in turn has allowed us to
[58:40.80] define an action of phi
[58:43.68] and implicitly thereby of course phi
[58:45.92] inverse
[58:46.80] on mixed tenses now
[58:58.48] and of course there's a implicit here in
[59:01.12] order for this to be well defined
[59:05.20] is the fact that phi star has got to be
[59:08.56] equal
[59:09.20] to phi inverse star you better check
[59:12.32] that
[59:12.80] it's important for things to be good
[59:20.56] okay and so the final uh definition i'll
[59:23.44] make before
[59:24.40] finishing up today is
[59:28.72] to isolate the special role played by
[59:31.36] certain diphymorphisms
[59:34.56] in general relativity and in
[59:36.16] differential geometry
[59:37.68] so there are special diphthiamorphisms
[59:44.84] phi
[59:47.60] namely those that are such that
[59:52.80] the metric is invariant under applying
[59:58.84] diffumorphism
[60:02.96] and those now we can actually write down
[60:05.12] that expression what does it mean
[60:06.96] for a uh the metric to be left invariant
[60:09.84] well you you need to have an action of
[60:11.28] the lithomorphism on the metric
[60:13.20] that we've just obtained above and
[60:15.68] therefore there are a special class of
[60:17.28] diffumorphisms which leave the metric
[60:18.88] absolutely alone
[60:20.00] and those are called isometries so these
[60:21.60] are these are the fundam these
[60:23.68] symmetries are the the fundamental
[60:25.52] symmetries of space-time
[60:27.44] however the symmetries of general
[60:28.96] relativity are
[60:31.36] actually much larger than just
[60:34.80] isometries because it will turn out
[60:38.40] that diffiomorphisms are in fact
[60:42.48] will yield identical manifold structures
[60:45.12] and
[60:45.60] the general relativity is written in
[60:47.20] terms of of coordinate free expressions
[60:49.60] of the metric
[60:51.12] so that when you apply a diffumorphism
[60:53.84] to a manifold you actually get
[60:55.76] physic when you you look at physical
[60:57.36] quantities you'll find
[60:59.12] that they lead to physically they'll
[61:00.80] lead to operationally identical
[61:02.08] predictions
[61:02.80] so the actual symmetries of general
[61:04.48] relativity will be deformable
[61:06.00] but we'll talk about that in the next
[61:08.08] lecture
[61:09.04] for today that's it thank you very much
[61:12.56] for your time and see you next time
