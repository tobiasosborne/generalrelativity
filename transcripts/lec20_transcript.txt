[00:00.00] hello and welcome back to introduction
[00:01.76] to general relativity
[00:03.12] in the previous lecture we left off
[00:04.64] discussing and introducing static
[00:06.80] spherically symmetric solutions like
[00:08.40] transfield equations
[00:10.24] this topic naturally leads us to the
[00:12.72] second and
[00:14.32] also one of the most celebrated solution
[00:16.64] of einstein's field equations namely the
[00:18.16] schwarzschild solution
[00:20.08] so if you recall in the previous lecture
[00:21.60] we argued that the metric
[00:24.08] of a static spherically symmetric
[00:27.04] rotationally
[00:28.84] invariant
[00:31.84] all right that's what spherically
[00:33.12] symmetric means
[00:35.92] uh such a metric takes the following
[00:38.88] form
[00:40.64] or one can choose a coordinate system
[00:44.48] where the metric takes the following
[00:47.76] form
[00:50.64] so this was the content of the previous
[00:52.96] lecture
[00:57.04] and this is the solution that we will
[01:00.32] we so found now this isn't quite a
[01:03.12] solution to einstein's field equations
[01:05.52] rather this is just the application of
[01:07.92] the symmetries
[01:11.04] that we demand of the solution on the
[01:13.28] form of the metric
[01:14.96] so we've just written down a metric the
[01:17.28] most general one that's static and
[01:18.56] spherically symmetric
[01:20.16] and this is not yet a solution to
[01:22.24] einstein's field equations we have to
[01:23.76] deal with two
[01:24.80] two unknowns here that we'll have to
[01:27.76] solve for
[01:29.20] so we've got a function f r
[01:32.64] and a function hr
[01:40.56] and our task today is to solve
[01:43.76] for these two functions they're simple
[01:45.44] functions of a single variable namely
[01:47.12] the radial component
[01:48.00] r and
[01:51.20] in order to solve for these we need to
[01:53.76] to substitute
[01:55.04] the metric into einstein's field
[01:56.48] equations work out the
[01:58.88] crystal symbols work out the richie
[02:00.64] tensor and so on
[02:02.40] and then also equate it to the stress
[02:05.36] energy tensor
[02:06.24] and today we're going to be looking only
[02:07.76] at the vacuum case
[02:09.28] so that's where the stress energy tends
[02:11.44] to be zero so we're going to eventually
[02:13.20] equate the richie tensor to zero and
[02:15.12] then we're going to find conditions that
[02:16.72] uh
[02:17.12] f and h have to satisfy in order to be a
[02:19.92] solution or furnish a solution to
[02:21.44] einstein's field equation
[02:22.88] in the absence of any stress energy
[02:27.68] so let's start it's a purely mechanical
[02:31.04] procedure now we just take the metric
[02:32.80] and we start
[02:33.52] computing and that's going to be the
[02:35.52] goal for the next two lectures
[02:38.40] so we start by summarizing the
[02:40.56] components of the metric
[02:46.08] so we've got the metric written
[02:49.44] in this differential form up above
[02:53.52] but it's also convenient just to write
[02:55.60] out the components of the metric in
[02:57.20] component form
[02:58.64] so we only have four nonzero components
[03:01.28] we have the time
[03:02.08] time component which is minus fr we have
[03:05.12] the radial radial component which is hr
[03:08.80] we have the theta theta component which
[03:12.16] is r squared
[03:13.52] and we have the phi phi component which
[03:16.96] is
[03:17.20] r squared sine squared theta
[03:21.84] now that we have the metric and it's
[03:23.12] diagonal right that's kind of really
[03:24.72] nice that if you were to put this in
[03:26.24] matrix form
[03:27.28] you would see that this is a diagonal
[03:28.72] 4x4 matrix
[03:30.32] then we can easily invert the the metric
[03:33.28] to find its components
[03:34.96] the inverse matrix components and
[03:38.40] we easily
[03:41.44] find that the inverse metric has the
[03:44.64] following components
[03:46.56] here
[03:50.00] it's also a diagonal matrix of course
[03:58.16] so now we've got the components of the
[03:59.52] metric both the
[04:01.28] metric and its inverse we can go ahead
[04:03.84] and compute
[04:04.56] the christopher symbols it's the next
[04:06.24] part of our task
[04:07.92] to get at the
[04:11.28] britchy tensor for this metric
[04:16.24] so this is well a little bit of an
[04:19.04] exercise
[04:20.08] it's not the world's most complicated
[04:22.80] computation
[04:24.24] but you know there's a little bit of
[04:26.40] hard work involved here
[04:27.68] in working out the crystal symbols
[04:31.04] you have to do some partial derivatives
[04:33.12] and
[04:35.52] work out which components are
[04:40.84] non-trivial
[04:42.40] but essentially it's a mechanical
[04:43.84] computation that you can
[04:45.52] put into your favorite algebra program
[04:48.08] if you don't care to do
[04:49.20] the computation uh there are more
[04:52.88] elegant
[04:53.52] ways to compute the richie tensor it
[04:55.76] must be said we could use the tetrad
[04:57.52] formalism which i didn't cover in this
[04:59.20] course
[05:00.64] that's probably better best left for a
[05:02.48] more advanced course
[05:03.92] so in the tetrad formalism there is
[05:05.84] another way to get at the ritchie tensor
[05:09.68] i won't be uh doing i'll just show you
[05:12.48] the most direct way
[05:14.08] um because this minimizes the amount of
[05:17.28] magic
[05:17.84] involved in in the computation you see
[05:19.84] that is purely a mechanical procedure
[05:26.08] so it's now an exercise to show that all
[05:28.24] the christopherson
[05:29.68] the only non-zero crystal symbols are
[05:31.36] the following ones
[05:33.28] so we've got a long list
[05:44.00] so it's more really a bookkeeping
[05:45.60] problem i don't think any single crystal
[05:47.68] symbol is difficult to compute
[05:50.40] certainly you could leave this as a
[05:51.76] homework in a first year
[05:53.92] calculus course but
[05:57.84] the main task is more the the
[06:00.16] bookkeeping
[06:00.88] keeping track of all these symbols so
[06:03.12] you don't
[06:04.08] don't mislabel one forget one
[06:07.44] that's zero when it should be non-zero
[06:09.92] or whatever
[06:19.12] so as always there's some probability
[06:21.68] that i make a transcription error
[06:26.16] so it's not only an exercise for the
[06:28.48] good of your soul
[06:29.84] to work out these christopher symbols
[06:32.32] it's also a great form of error
[06:33.84] correction
[06:34.96] to ensure that i haven't made a mistake
[06:37.28] in writing down these crystal symbols
[06:40.32] so i highly encourage you to work out at
[06:42.56] least one or two maybe take a random
[06:46.84] sample
[06:48.08] and uh convince yourself that either
[06:50.32] i've written the right christopher
[06:51.52] symbols down or the wrong ones
[06:54.32] and then tell me in the comments
[07:00.40] okay hopefully though i've written down
[07:04.08] the correct ones and then
[07:07.44] and then we have all the information we
[07:09.52] now need to start computing the rigid
[07:11.36] tensor
[07:12.80] so you know i've i i've uh
[07:16.08] implied that there are more
[07:17.04] sophisticated ways to write down the
[07:18.40] rigid tensor
[07:19.28] well we're going to take the least
[07:20.56] sophisticated route
[07:22.56] in order to not obscure the physics here
[07:25.44] and at least
[07:26.80] the least sophisticated route to
[07:28.48] computing the ritchie tensor is just to
[07:30.00] go to the component formalism for the
[07:32.08] riemann tensor
[07:33.92] and then contract
[07:40.08] and in particular if you look at the the
[07:43.04] lecture that i gave at the
[07:44.32] end of the discussion of differential
[07:47.28] geometry you'll be able to find
[07:49.68] this formula here
[07:55.68] which is just a contracted form of the
[07:58.08] riemann tensor
[08:02.24] so we have at our disposal now all the
[08:04.56] crystal symbols now we just have to go
[08:06.24] through the tedious task
[08:07.52] of carrying out
[08:11.12] these contractions and multiplications
[08:19.04] and that's another exercise
[08:25.36] um you should uh
[08:29.84] should find actually that the answer is
[08:31.52] pretty simple so
[08:33.60] maybe the easiest way to to start this
[08:36.80] exercise is to first convince yourself
[08:38.88] that the riemann tensor is zero
[08:41.12] as long as mu is not equal to nu okay so
[08:44.32] that only leaves you with four
[08:45.76] four things to actually compute and then
[08:52.32] you can look at the four components of
[08:54.08] the richie tensor then
[08:56.88] in turn
[09:15.12] and these are you know not uncon not
[09:17.68] uncomplicated
[09:18.80] but again this is
[09:22.72] calculus straightforward calculus
[09:24.56] there's no sophisticated
[09:25.92] anything's going on here
[09:48.84] um
[10:05.76] and we come to the fourth and final
[10:07.84] component non-trivial component
[10:09.92] of the rigid tensor
[10:15.12] which is the time time component which i
[10:16.80] read down last
[10:26.40] so they're starting to look well
[10:29.68] a bit intricate lots of f's and r's and
[10:32.00] their derivatives
[10:34.80] but actually the remarkable thing about
[10:37.68] the schwarzschild solution is how easy
[10:39.68] the actual
[10:42.16] equations are to solve in the end
[10:46.08] so there we go we've summarized the
[10:48.24] non-trivial components of the riemann
[10:51.28] of the richie tensor and that's what we
[10:54.00] need now to apply einstein's equations
[11:00.80] and that's what we're going to do next
[11:01.84] right so what we're going to what we're
[11:03.20] trying to do here
[11:04.08] at this stage is model the gravitational
[11:06.48] field outside
[11:08.00] of some spherical source
[11:11.84] we'll get to the inside part in the next
[11:13.76] lecture so
[11:14.88] outside of a spherically symmetric
[11:17.52] distribution of stress energy
[11:19.28] the gravitational field should be
[11:21.68] spherically symmetric
[11:23.04] right and outside this source
[11:26.32] the stress energy tends to zero so
[11:28.24] that's what we're going to do first so
[11:29.36] you've got to imagine you know we have
[11:30.72] some
[11:31.60] celestial body a star indeed that's
[11:34.40] pretty much all we're going to
[11:35.52] focus on in this course is a star so
[11:38.08] here it is there's a big
[11:39.36] hot liquid gas thing
[11:42.56] and the gravitation you know the star
[11:45.84] deforms the gravitational field thanks
[11:48.96] to einstein's field equation this is my
[11:51.76] cartoon for the gravitational field
[11:53.44] these blue lines here
[11:58.64] and we assume that there's no
[12:01.84] part of the star outside of the the body
[12:04.64] of the star right
[12:05.68] there's no atoms or any stress form of
[12:08.48] stress energy outside of the start
[12:10.72] and we're we're at the currently
[12:14.56] we're solving for the gravitational
[12:17.04] field which is just the metric
[12:21.20] what we're going to do in the next
[12:24.00] lecture is to solve the gravitational
[12:25.52] field
[12:26.16] outside the celestial body
[12:33.68] and the the gravitational field
[12:38.00] inside
[12:41.52] the interior solution we'll do
[12:46.08] in the next lecture
[12:54.72] so in order to solve for the
[12:58.24] gravitational field outside the star we
[12:59.60] need the vacuum einstein's field
[13:04.84] equations
[13:26.96] and then we're going to find in the next
[13:28.24] lecture the interior solution with the
[13:30.08] the usual non-vacuum einstein field
[13:32.56] equations i'm going to paste the two
[13:34.00] solutions together
[13:37.04] now we won't quite use just the vacuum
[13:38.96] einstein's field equation it's actually
[13:40.24] going to use the trace free form or
[13:41.92] trace
[13:42.32] sorry not tracer3 the trace reversed
[13:44.24] form so recall
[13:46.84] from lecture 13
[13:52.08] the uh what you could call trace
[13:54.80] reversed form
[14:00.16] of einstein's field equations which read
[14:02.32] r mu nu equals eight pi
[14:05.36] and we've gotten rid of the metric from
[14:07.84] einstein's tensor and then we replace
[14:11.28] that contribution with the contribution
[14:13.12] coming from the trace of the stress
[14:14.40] energy tensor so this is a completely
[14:16.16] equivalent form of insurance field
[14:17.60] equations
[14:18.80] and and the reason we like this form
[14:23.92] is that in a vacuum
[14:29.36] uh t minu equals zero
[14:32.56] and therefore of course so does t so
[14:35.44] actually
[14:36.00] uh the einstein's field equations in a
[14:38.48] vacuum are super simple right it just
[14:39.84] says that the ritchie tensor they just
[14:41.44] say the rigid tensor
[14:42.56] is zero and since we've already got four
[14:46.16] components of the richie tensor
[14:49.28] we just have to equate these four
[14:50.64] components to zero and so
[14:53.92] uh that makes our life super easy right
[14:56.16] it just suffices
[15:00.64] to set just three equations to zero
[15:10.72] y3 well if you look back up at the
[15:12.32] ritchie tensor here the
[15:13.84] the the phi phi component is just
[15:15.60] proportional to the theta theta
[15:16.96] component so
[15:18.32] you know you get it for free
[15:22.72] um and well you could just go through
[15:25.04] and do that
[15:27.12] so let's you know you take the ritchie
[15:28.96] tensor you take these components
[15:31.36] then you set them to zero and then you
[15:33.76] you set about the task of solving this
[15:35.84] coupled sort of nonlinear differential
[15:37.36] equations and the first thing you might
[15:39.12] do is start to eliminate
[15:40.40] you know epson h's and uh i'll save you
[15:43.52] the bother
[15:45.20] and just point out that you can you can
[15:48.64] do that
[15:52.56] by you can eliminate the
[15:57.52] uh you don't quite eliminate the f's and
[16:01.12] the h's
[16:02.00] but you can place you can exploit the
[16:04.96] the three equations that are now
[16:06.40] einstein's field equations
[16:08.24] to derive a very simple form
[16:11.76] or to derive a very simple
[16:14.88] equation that needs to be satisfied
[16:23.52] and this particular equation relates f
[16:26.32] the derivative of f and the derivative
[16:27.84] of h
[16:31.52] right this equation is going to be zero
[16:33.92] and so if you add these two particular
[16:36.40] combinations of rtt and r and then you
[16:39.44] see that you get this equation
[16:41.36] on the right and of course the the r
[16:43.76] over
[16:44.40] the one over r times h our component
[16:47.84] cancels out and you're left with the
[16:48.88] incredibly simple equation right you're
[16:50.72] left with f prime over f
[16:52.72] plus h prime over h is zero
[16:56.08] well another way of writing that is that
[16:59.28] f is just equal to a constant times by h
[17:02.64] to the minus 1.
[17:06.64] so that's pretty cool you know we've
[17:09.44] already completely eliminated
[17:11.36] h from the story
[17:18.80] and this constant well we can rescale
[17:21.44] time
[17:24.32] to get rid of that constant
[17:30.80] so if we take t goes to root k t
[17:35.16] [Music]
[17:36.72] we may just simply set k equal to one
[17:43.20] now uh well we may as well use the
[17:45.76] information we have at hand
[17:51.52] namely r theta theta is in r theta theta
[17:59.60] to get the following consequence if we
[18:00.96] go back to r t to theta so if you look
[18:02.56] at r theta theta here and you use the
[18:04.24] fact that
[18:05.60] well you know f
[18:08.72] is minus one over h
[18:13.60] sorry f is 1 over h then
[18:16.64] then things simplify pretty pretty
[18:18.32] dramatically and we're left with
[18:21.68] this rather simple equation namely minus
[18:24.72] f
[18:24.96] prime plus 1 minus f over r is
[18:28.00] zero and that you can totally
[18:31.92] you can rearrange to get a total
[18:33.52] derivative
[18:38.16] and uh well that you can integrate
[18:42.80] to get that f is one plus some constant
[18:45.68] over r
[18:55.68] and what we've just done is we've
[18:56.88] actually just solved for the metric
[19:13.28] now we'll just substitute in what we've
[19:15.04] obtained for f and
[19:22.84] h
[19:31.04] and then we'll see we've reduced
[19:32.08] everything down to one
[19:34.80] undetermined constant which we will
[19:37.60] determine
[19:38.16] in the course of the next minutes
[19:48.40] so we've used an abbreviation here
[20:00.08] and this particular solution this is
[20:02.24] what we call
[20:04.80] the schwarzschild metric
[20:13.36] and it was obtained in 1916
[20:18.84] by
[20:20.24] so we have this constant c inside the
[20:22.32] the schwarzschild metric
[20:23.76] and you know what should that constant
[20:26.80] be
[20:27.84] you know there's since we're talking
[20:29.84] about a celestial body
[20:31.92] as a source for this uh gravitational
[20:34.16] field
[20:35.12] um there's not many constants you might
[20:37.92] attach to a celestial body
[20:39.60] and so the first guess and the correct
[20:41.68] guess right is that c is somehow
[20:43.04] proportional to the mass
[20:46.08] and and that we'll interpret in a second
[20:49.04] or that we'll argue in a second
[20:51.60] and uh but before we do that i just want
[20:53.60] to point out that you know
[20:54.64] this went rather painlessly this uh
[20:57.04] solution of einstein's field equations
[20:59.44] and unfortunately this is not the nature
[21:02.40] of things
[21:03.04] uh it's not easy to solve einstein's
[21:05.52] field equations on the on
[21:06.88] the contrary it's an extraordinarily
[21:09.12] intricate and
[21:10.00] uh involved task to actually solve one
[21:12.88] shots field occasions in general
[21:14.88] we've just selected in this course out
[21:16.96] the very best two solutions
[21:18.96] that really uh
[21:22.24] illustrate the illustrate some
[21:25.68] extraordinary amounts of physics with an
[21:27.20] extraordinary little amount of work
[21:29.60] by exploiting certain symmetries in
[21:32.72] particular
[21:33.76] spherical symmetry in this case here so
[21:36.72] the schwarzschild solution should be you
[21:38.32] know you should think of this as kind of
[21:39.52] like the hydrogen atom
[21:42.32] of general relativity or hydrogen atom
[21:44.80] is the
[21:45.44] solution of quantum mechanics if you
[21:46.88] like um
[21:48.80] they both pertain to spherically
[21:50.00] symmetric um
[21:52.16] entities and they both are extremely
[21:55.12] important in cosmology
[21:59.84] now we want to interpret this constant c
[22:02.48] right
[22:03.12] so how we're going to do that well you
[22:05.20] know one is just by saying what else
[22:06.72] could it be
[22:07.68] that's one way to interpret it well
[22:10.64] that's not quite as satisfying
[22:12.16] uh you you maybe gotta work a little
[22:15.28] harder
[22:16.32] and one way to do this is to just argue
[22:19.12] about what happens as r tends to
[22:20.56] infinity well
[22:21.68] in the limit r tends to infinity right
[22:23.36] just set r is infinity in this metric
[22:25.28] here i know it's not well defined but
[22:27.20] take a look at the first two terms
[22:29.04] you'll see that they both
[22:30.80] basically tend down the first two terms
[22:33.20] in the solution 10 to minus dt squared
[22:35.12] plus tr squared
[22:38.88] and so in that case you can say that the
[22:41.28] metric is a
[22:42.08] is approaching i mean to make this
[22:43.60] rigorous you do need to work a little
[22:45.04] harder but
[22:46.08] uh this is already sufficient actually
[22:48.96] for
[22:49.44] um identifying the constant
[22:52.64] so in the limit that r tends to infinity
[22:54.72] this this metric actually approaches the
[22:56.88] minkowski metric
[23:03.04] uh and you should think of these c over
[23:06.00] r terms as like a perturbation
[23:18.08] and there is a place where you can
[23:21.92] understand
[23:24.08] perturbations and general relativity
[23:25.60] right we covered that
[23:31.52] when we looked at linearized general
[23:34.84] relativity
[23:36.40] or general relativity in perturbation
[23:38.32] theory
[23:41.92] and we derived a pretty general formula
[23:44.48] for
[23:45.12] the metric in perturbation theory
[23:50.32] in the newtonian limit
[23:59.28] and so what we're going to do is we're
[24:00.24] going to compare the motion of a test
[24:02.08] body in the newtonian limit with the
[24:03.84] motion of a test body in the
[24:05.12] schwarzschild solution here
[24:07.04] and then then we'll be able to interpret
[24:09.28] that constant directly
[24:32.00] so we're all doing this in the weak
[24:33.28] field limit right
[24:38.56] this is an excellent exercise for you
[24:45.60] all right this should test your
[24:48.40] knowledge of the newtonian theory
[24:50.08] of the schwarzschild solution
[24:58.00] this is equation star by the way
[25:01.04] and what you should conclude after your
[25:03.36] exercise is that the constant
[25:05.20] should be to be consistent with the
[25:06.96] newtonian weak field limit
[25:09.28] the constant should be minus 2m where m
[25:11.36] is the mass of the celestial body
[25:29.60] and setting c is this constant
[25:37.28] gives us the final form of the solution
[26:09.28] and that's it that's pretty pretty
[26:10.80] awesome an amazing
[26:12.56] accomplishment uh this this metric does
[26:15.68] indeed differ
[26:16.72] from the newtonian theory especially for
[26:19.36] large m
[26:20.88] and we're going to investigate in the
[26:23.36] next lecture
[26:24.16] and in the following lectures the motion
[26:26.16] of test bodies
[26:27.20] in the presence of this metric and we'll
[26:30.08] see
[26:30.48] that this leads to some of the most
[26:32.64] celebrated uh
[26:34.00] predictions and verify now verified
[26:36.08] experimentally of general relativity
[26:39.76] so before we we finish the discussion of
[26:42.24] the schwarzschild metric
[26:43.44] the external vacuum solution
[26:46.48] i want to point out that there are some
[26:48.52] peculiarities about this solution
[26:52.00] there are
[26:58.16] two singularities
[27:04.64] in the solution right you should be at a
[27:06.24] spot where they are right what happens
[27:07.68] when r is zero well that doesn't look so
[27:09.44] good does it
[27:10.16] um you've got like infinite minus
[27:11.92] infinity times dt squared and
[27:14.00] minus infinity times d uh sorry
[27:17.68] um just just one single singularity on
[27:19.76] the time component
[27:21.60] and uh and so that doesn't look good um
[27:26.88] and there's also a second one right what
[27:28.16] happens if r is 2m
[27:31.04] it'll also make things go infinite
[27:34.80] so we have to think about these
[27:39.28] singularities
[27:44.48] and try and interpret them are they real
[27:46.32] singularities or are they just simply
[27:48.40] the results of
[27:49.44] a bad coordinate patch right you know it
[27:51.92] could be
[27:52.64] either space time is a manifold we've
[27:54.24] chosen the coordinate patch for our
[27:55.84] manifold
[27:56.56] perhaps our chart just simply breaks
[27:59.60] down
[28:00.48] at one of these points and actually the
[28:03.12] the manifold itself
[28:04.40] is the full solution is nice and smooth
[28:06.00] and there are no problems
[28:08.08] well that actually is the case
[28:13.20] in in for the singularity at r equals 2m
[28:18.48] that is a coordinate singularity i mean
[28:20.40] it's a little bit complicated to argue
[28:28.84] that
[28:37.52] it's a little bit uh uh complicated to
[28:40.64] organize
[28:41.28] a little bit complicated to argue that
[28:45.04] so we won't actually argue this here
[28:54.24] um because in a way it turns out to be
[28:57.36] not relevant
[28:58.08] we will actually paste on this
[28:59.84] coordinate patch with the interior
[29:01.68] solution and the reason why
[29:02.96] is this
[29:06.56] it's the following so for usual objects
[29:08.72] right you know
[29:12.64] um eg
[29:16.64] not black holes
[29:23.20] this radius r equals 2m where is it you
[29:26.08] might wonder where is this
[29:27.28] this this singularity
[29:31.52] well if you reintroduce big g uh
[29:35.12] the the the this point r equals 2m
[29:38.32] usually lies very deep within the object
[29:40.64] itself
[29:45.28] so for example for the sun
[29:51.60] rs this breakdown point
[29:59.36] uh where does that lie well it lies at
[30:01.04] about 2.95
[30:06.84] kilometers
[30:08.08] is well you know right in the center of
[30:09.92] the sun but that's
[30:11.20] exactly where the vacuum einstein the
[30:13.60] field equations aren't meant
[30:15.04] to apply
[30:32.96] the same holds for the singularity
[30:34.48] obviously at rs0 the only place
[30:37.92] where we have to take really care about
[30:39.60] these singularities is of course for
[30:42.48] more exotic objects in our universe
[30:45.28] namely black holes
[30:46.96] in that case one has to take more care
[30:49.20] about
[30:50.88] the schwarzschild solution but that is
[30:53.44] not unfortunately a topic for this
[30:54.96] course it's an advanced topic
[30:56.48] a highly interesting topic which we will
[30:59.52] i will postpone to the advanced
[31:03.20] course on general relativity um
[31:06.64] and instead we'll move on in the next
[31:09.20] lecture
[31:10.48] to discussing interior solutions so what
[31:12.72] the
[31:14.56] what is the solution to einstein's field
[31:16.40] equation look like for a static
[31:17.44] spherically symmetric body
[31:20.80] with spherical symmetric distribution of
[31:23.60] stress and energy
[31:25.12] and we'll derive that in the next
[31:26.24] lecture and
[31:28.64] then we'll commence the discussions the
[31:31.28] discussion
[31:32.00] of the motion of test bodies in the
[31:34.56] presence
[31:35.76] of the schwarzschild solution but that's
[31:37.68] a topic
[31:39.20] for next week for now that's it
[31:42.40] until next time goodbye
