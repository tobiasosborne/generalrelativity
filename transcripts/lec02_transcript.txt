[00:00.00] hello and welcome back to introduction
[00:01.52] to general relativity
[00:03.12] in the previous lecture we commenced our
[00:05.36] journey into the theory of general
[00:07.04] relativity by reviewing some of the
[00:08.80] fundamental assumptions underlying
[00:10.32] newtonian physics
[00:12.00] in today's lecture i'm going to
[00:13.28] introduce to you the main
[00:15.12] two main big principles that underlie
[00:18.48] the underlie the formulation of general
[00:20.72] relativity and
[00:21.76] motivated einstein to discover the
[00:23.52] theory of general relativity in the
[00:24.80] first place namely
[00:26.24] we're going to discuss the principle of
[00:27.60] equivalence and mark's principle
[00:31.68] so the modern formulation of
[00:35.04] general relativity is uh now
[00:40.64] consists of a large amount of
[00:43.84] mathematical formalism
[00:45.60] but this formalism is all is
[00:48.80] very naturally a consequence of a couple
[00:50.96] of physical principles
[00:53.20] and the first principle and really
[00:56.56] arguably the most important principle
[00:58.16] underlying the
[00:59.76] formulation of general relativity is
[01:01.68] what's known as the principle of
[01:03.04] equivalent or einstein's equivalence
[01:04.64] principle
[01:05.36] so write that down the first
[01:12.24] and certainly most influential principle
[01:14.48] underlying
[01:17.44] general relativity is this einstein's
[01:20.16] equivalence
[01:24.84] principle e e p
[01:27.84] for short now einstein's equivalence
[01:30.96] principle
[01:32.08] uh consists really in the modern
[01:34.48] understanding today
[01:35.92] of really three parts
[01:39.68] one of them we've already seen
[01:44.24] so the first part we saw in the previous
[01:46.72] lecture and that's the
[01:48.00] the principle of uff
[01:51.28] universality of free fall
[02:03.44] and this is this is another name
[02:08.88] it's also known as the weak equivalence
[02:20.84] principle
[02:25.68] or wep for short
[02:29.68] and the content of this principle where
[02:31.36] we discussed in the previous lecture it
[02:32.80] says that
[02:33.52] spatial orbits of test particles only
[02:35.52] depend on the initial conditions
[02:37.68] and not on the physical or chemical
[02:41.04] properties of a test particle
[02:45.12] uff wep have been experimentally
[02:48.84] verified
[02:58.48] eg in torsion balance experiments
[03:09.36] i mean it's a bit rushed to say that
[03:10.80] they've been verified
[03:12.72] they've been not rejected
[03:17.28] the key point in physics of course is
[03:19.20] that we can't confirm a hypothesis we
[03:21.04] can only reject a hypothesis
[03:22.40] experimentally
[03:24.48] okay that that that we really discussed
[03:27.04] uh
[03:27.52] in more detail in the previous lecture
[03:28.96] and the consequences of uff
[03:31.52] in today's lecture i'm going to now
[03:34.48] introduce to you the other aspects of
[03:36.48] the einstein's equivalence principle
[03:38.40] the second aspect is local lawrence
[03:44.84] invariants
[03:48.80] and this is uh abbreviated lli
[03:52.80] and it says that in a freely falling
[03:54.32] reference frame
[03:55.84] the laws of non-gravitational physics
[03:57.68] are those of special relativity
[04:00.00] so in particular they don't depend on
[04:01.68] spatial orientation or velocity
[04:04.00] so i'll just quickly summarize that
[04:24.00] so freely following reference frame the
[04:25.36] laws of physics are those of special
[04:26.84] relativity
[04:29.28] and you can summarize this as saying
[04:31.52] that there's no
[04:33.28] preferred
[04:36.40] reference frame
[04:43.44] and we talked about preferred reference
[04:45.84] frames in newtonian physics
[04:50.64] and this is one of those notions that
[04:52.16] you have to give up on when you move
[04:54.08] transition to special relativity but not
[04:56.48] general relativity
[04:59.12] uh you already have to give up on when
[05:01.20] you go to special relativity
[05:04.72] so laws
[05:08.00] in particular the laws of physics
[05:13.52] don't depend on velocity or rotation or
[05:22.84] orientation
[05:30.16] orientation or
[05:33.36] velocity
[05:37.60] now uh local lawrence and variance is a
[05:41.92] an assumption that you've got a
[05:44.56] hypothesis and you can reject the
[05:46.16] hypothesis
[05:47.44] and nicholson-morley type experiments
[05:55.12] have been unable to reject this
[05:57.44] hypothesis
[05:58.40] the hypothesis of lli um
[06:02.72] and they've delivered to us the best
[06:04.84] bounds
[06:06.64] which are
[06:09.84] now of the order of delta c
[06:13.20] over c is something like 5 by 10 to the
[06:15.84] minus 17. so pretty extraordinary
[06:19.76] bounds on the variation of the speed of
[06:22.00] light
[06:23.84] as you change orientation or reference
[06:25.76] frame
[06:27.04] there's a third aspect to what we now
[06:29.52] call einstein's equivalence principle
[06:31.44] namely local position invariants
[06:34.80] right maybe it's maybe it's kind of
[06:36.88] obvious but you gotta
[06:39.04] spell these assumptions out
[06:42.56] this is lpi and this simply says that
[06:45.68] the laws of physics do not
[06:47.28] depend on position
[06:51.84] so sr holds
[06:55.12] special relativity holds independent
[07:00.56] of space time position right you know
[07:03.60] you can have position in space but you
[07:05.04] also have position
[07:06.00] in time so there's
[07:09.04] another way of saying this is there's no
[07:11.28] preferred location
[07:13.04] in space time
[07:22.16] and you can reformulate three if you
[07:28.84] like
[07:30.64] to perhaps a more familiar
[07:34.48] formulation one that einstein was
[07:36.32] certainly motivating motivated einstein
[07:38.16] heavily
[07:38.96] and this is the the principle of the
[07:42.40] universality of gravitational redshift
[07:45.04] so principle 3 is also equivalent
[07:48.72] which is an exercise for you
[07:52.40] to the universality of gravitational
[07:56.84] redshift
[08:05.04] what always known as u g r
[08:10.08] another way of saying that is that clock
[08:12.48] rates are universally affected
[08:14.24] by the gravitational field
[08:36.24] so this is a this is a fundamental
[08:39.44] assumption underlying
[08:40.64] the einstein's equivalence principle
[08:43.76] now uh to get you uh into the mood and
[08:46.96] spirit and
[08:47.84] uh into practice with these kinds of
[08:49.92] calculations we're gonna set an exercise
[08:53.12] this one's will be on the the homework
[08:56.24] sheets but
[08:58.32] all these exercises on the homework
[08:59.68] sheets will be mentioned in the lecture
[09:01.68] so we're going to show you the task is
[09:03.76] to show or argue
[09:06.16] that for small velocities
[09:12.72] and weak gravitational fields so we
[09:15.20] don't expect any
[09:19.52] black holes or anything
[09:23.76] so for weak gravitational fields such as
[09:25.44] what we experience here on earth
[09:27.84] that delta nu over nu is
[09:31.44] equal to delta phi over c squared
[09:34.96] so um where where i'm going to tell you
[09:38.40] what these symbols are
[09:40.48] new x1 and ux2 these are the clock rates
[09:45.52] of two clocks
[09:54.56] uh we'll name the clocks as clock 1 and
[09:56.88] this clock 2
[09:58.24] and these clocks are at locations x1 and
[10:01.60] or x2 so there's a picture right you
[10:04.16] know you have somehow a clock here
[10:08.88] and then you have a clock here and
[10:10.80] another it's based on locations is
[10:13.68] somehow x1 x2
[10:16.96] so what's phi phi is the gravitational
[10:20.16] scalar potential which we met in the
[10:23.92] previous
[10:25.68] lecture since phi x1 5
[10:29.12] x2 and delta
[10:34.08] phi is just the difference of course
[10:35.52] between these two uh
[10:38.40] scalar potentials so gravity is pointing
[10:40.88] somewhere down in this picture
[10:42.80] so delta phi is phi of x1 minus
[10:46.00] phi of x2 and your task
[10:49.52] is uh to
[10:52.56] argue that delta nu over nu the
[10:55.28] difference in these clock rates
[10:56.88] is proportional to the difference in the
[10:59.60] gravitational scale of field
[11:01.28] divided by the speed of light squared
[11:03.12] you can do that with a doppler shift
[11:05.12] argument or you can use
[11:06.72] if you like a uh
[11:11.04] the quantum expression for
[11:14.32] uh the energy of a photon and
[11:17.84] argue how that would change at different
[11:19.44] points in the gravitational field
[11:21.76] there's two ways to to at least to to
[11:24.32] argue
[11:25.04] this relation and uh and the second part
[11:28.48] of this exercise is to estimate
[11:32.96] um delta phi over c
[11:36.64] uh in our gravitational field
[11:39.92] field of the earth for it
[11:43.28] for a uh for a displacement of
[11:46.32] 30 centimeters so
[11:53.60] so when the two clocks are only 30
[11:55.36] centimeters separated which i can
[11:57.04] indicate almost by my hands here
[11:59.20] there we go it's about well a bit less
[12:02.56] 25 there and estimate
[12:05.76] the this this change in these ticking of
[12:09.20] these two clocks
[12:10.48] and you'll get a small number right and
[12:12.24] the interesting thing is you should do a
[12:13.68] bit of googling what's the best
[12:15.36] the best balance delivered by atomic
[12:17.84] clocks on
[12:19.68] measuring clock rates and you should you
[12:22.72] should conclude that this is now
[12:24.40] routinely measurable in the
[12:25.92] laboratory experiments in fact if kind
[12:28.32] of like you know if you are curious you
[12:29.84] should investigate what are the current
[12:31.44] bounds now
[12:32.72] on on differences on
[12:36.08] uh on delta
[12:40.16] on the differences between differences
[12:42.96] of heights where the gravitational
[12:44.24] redshift is measurable in laboratory
[12:46.08] experiments you'll be pretty surprised
[12:47.60] by what we can
[12:48.64] measure in the lab in terms of
[12:49.92] gravitational red trip
[12:53.12] so it's a curious thing so that that
[12:56.08] that's
[12:56.48] already you know what have we done we've
[12:57.84] i've i've described to you the principle
[13:00.16] einstein's equivalence principle as it's
[13:02.48] a modern formulation of eep as it is
[13:06.08] found in the modern formulation of
[13:07.68] general relativity and i've
[13:09.44] isolated three aspects to eep namely
[13:13.12] the universality of free fall lawrence
[13:15.84] local lawrence and variance
[13:17.12] and uh local positioning variants or ugr
[13:19.68] the universality of gravitational
[13:21.20] redshift
[13:23.20] now it's an interesting observation
[13:29.68] that using eep you can
[13:33.04] derive the gravity should be
[13:37.68] described
[13:46.84] geometrically so you've probably heard
[13:48.72] that einstein's
[13:50.08] general theory of relativity is a
[13:51.36] geometrical theory it sounds pretty
[13:53.60] magical right um pretty amazing lots of
[13:56.96] people have said lots of things about
[13:58.16] this
[13:59.12] uh and where does this come from well
[14:02.56] you know
[14:03.12] it's possible to derive this you can i
[14:05.76] would say argue this
[14:11.76] from the eep
[14:26.64] and i'll give you a reference it's not a
[14:29.76] very readable reference i'm afraid
[14:33.20] i took a look at it
[14:36.48] i think you have to be you wouldn't you
[14:39.04] wouldn't read this on your first
[14:41.44] encounter with general relativity but
[14:42.88] you might be curious to see where these
[14:44.48] arguments are laid down
[14:46.40] you can find them in this this journal
[14:48.16] article here
[14:52.24] by thornley enlightenment
[14:59.68] i wouldn't recommend you as i said it
[15:01.20] wouldn't if this is your first encounter
[15:02.48] with general relativity you wouldn't
[15:03.84] really recommend following this up
[15:05.76] unless you're particularly motivated
[15:10.84] and you know
[15:13.12] this is this is a key key feature of
[15:15.36] general relativity that that
[15:17.28] it's it's formulated in in a geometric
[15:20.00] fashion
[15:20.80] however there's some there's a key point
[15:22.32] i want to emphasize uh
[15:23.92] and that is that just phrasing a
[15:26.48] physical theory in geometrical terms is
[15:28.24] no particular magic
[15:29.84] you probably heard if you encountered
[15:32.08] any amount of popular science
[15:34.16] the idea statements that you know
[15:36.72] general relativity is
[15:38.08] special because it has this geometric
[15:40.24] formulation
[15:41.60] well it's not special if a physical
[15:43.28] theory has a geometric
[15:44.72] uh formulation in fact most if not all
[15:47.68] physical theories can be formulated
[15:49.20] geometrically
[15:50.32] for example newton newton's theory can
[15:53.04] be formulated geometrically
[15:54.56] thermodynamics can be formulated
[15:56.16] geometrically static statistical
[15:57.84] mechanics and quantum mechanics may be
[15:59.44] described geometrically
[16:01.76] in particular quantum mechanics can be
[16:03.44] described in terms of kela manifolds you
[16:05.28] can see that in my lectures on
[16:06.56] symplectic mechanics and
[16:08.48] synthetic geometry and classical
[16:10.24] mechanics
[16:12.16] if you're willing to work hard enough i
[16:13.68] claim you can just about formulate
[16:15.20] anything geometrically
[16:17.20] so the important point about einstein's
[16:19.20] theory of general relativity
[16:21.20] is that the key physical principle
[16:23.60] underlying this geometrization
[16:25.84] is that all matter from electrons
[16:28.32] protons gluons
[16:30.32] to the higgs they all couple to the same
[16:32.96] geometry
[16:33.76] namely that of space time so that's the
[16:36.16] fundamental thing
[16:37.28] that makes that distinguishes general
[16:38.80] relativity is a geometrical theory from
[16:41.12] any other theory and so let's write that
[16:44.00] out that's really important so all
[16:45.76] matter
[16:47.84] uh couples doesn't matter what the
[16:49.84] matter is right higgs is
[16:52.00] gluons you name it quarks
[16:55.52] they all matter couples to the same
[17:02.84] geometry
[17:04.40] we can't quantify this mathematically
[17:06.08] yet we will be able to as we go through
[17:07.76] this course
[17:09.20] and what geometry namely is that of
[17:12.24] space-time
[17:17.04] when you formulate all these other
[17:18.32] aforementioned theories geometrically
[17:20.00] you don't see that
[17:28.80] this is something very special about
[17:30.16] general relativity
[17:36.48] and because of this
[17:40.32] a single metric suffices to describe all
[17:42.96] indirection or coupled
[17:47.44] and we'll i'll explain to you what is a
[17:50.40] metric
[17:51.68] later in this course
[18:12.32] so don't worry about metrics we will
[18:14.24] talk about them later in the course
[18:18.00] uh to get you uh in the spirit of things
[18:20.80] we're gonna do some calculations now
[18:22.48] um these are
[18:26.48] these calculations are supporting
[18:28.72] various aspects of eep
[18:30.80] with respect to newtonian physics
[18:36.80] and i find these these calculations
[18:38.40] pretty enlightening especially since
[18:41.20] very soon like in the next couple of
[18:42.72] weeks we're going to be entering
[18:44.80] we're going to commence our studies of
[18:46.48] differential geometry and you'll quickly
[18:48.32] get
[18:49.60] bamboozled with afine and christopher
[18:52.16] connections and blah blah blah and you
[18:54.16] might wonder if these actually have
[18:55.36] anything to do with physics at all
[18:57.20] uh indeed they do and we'll see all
[19:01.68] we'll see many of those geometrical
[19:03.52] things turning up already in this
[19:04.88] quite simple calculations that we can do
[19:06.48] within newtonian physics right now
[19:12.32] okay let's start let's take aim at the
[19:13.76] following statement
[19:21.20] so the statement is no
[19:26.16] external
[19:30.24] static
[19:33.76] homogeneous these words are very
[19:35.92] important as you'll see
[19:39.04] gravitational field
[19:46.56] can be detected in a freely falling
[19:48.32] reference frame
[20:03.36] this is one of these classic thought
[20:04.64] experiments of
[20:07.84] einstein einstein's elevator
[20:11.28] nothing no external static homogeneous
[20:14.00] gravitational field can be detected in a
[20:15.52] freely falling elevator we're going to
[20:16.88] prove that now within
[20:18.96] newtonian physics note that
[20:22.64] that i'm stressing static homogeneous
[20:26.00] so if the gravitational field varies
[20:28.40] it's not homogeneous it's not
[20:29.68] translation invariant then you can
[20:31.04] detect it by tidal forces
[20:32.80] it's very important so
[20:35.84] let's uh how we're going to quantify how
[20:38.96] we're going to
[20:41.36] prove this statement within newtonian
[20:44.48] physics well
[20:45.52] we're going to suppose we have some
[20:47.68] physical system
[20:48.56] right and we're going to have n
[20:52.04] non-relativistic particles
[21:00.64] and they're moving
[21:06.80] in a pair force field
[21:15.76] described by big f which depends on the
[21:18.24] separations between these these
[21:20.00] these particles and they're not only
[21:23.52] moving in that
[21:25.20] pair force field they're also moving in
[21:27.04] and
[21:29.44] they're moving in an external
[21:30.80] gravitational field
[21:42.88] g of x just is a constant g
[21:45.92] homogeneous static doesn't change with
[21:47.92] time
[21:49.68] so what do we do well we
[21:53.68] we apply newton's second law to get the
[21:55.44] equations of motion
[22:00.08] how do they look well the mass of the
[22:02.16] j-th particle
[22:03.76] times by its acceleration
[22:07.92] is equal to the mass of the j-th
[22:09.36] particle times by g that's the static
[22:11.36] homogeneous gravitational field
[22:14.00] plus the sum of all the pair
[22:17.44] forces
[22:22.48] right that's newton's second law k runs
[22:25.28] from one to n
[22:26.16] and we just assume that f of zero is
[22:28.96] zero
[22:29.52] just to make this thing work out nicely
[22:34.08] so there you go look at newton's second
[22:35.44] law right you i can certainly see
[22:37.12] the gravitational term right there it's
[22:39.12] the first thing on the right hand side
[22:41.04] but we're not in a freely pulling
[22:42.56] reference frame so
[22:44.40] if we make a galilean transformation
[22:48.24] sorry a non-galilean right we're going
[22:50.40] to a
[22:52.24] an accelerating or freely falling
[22:54.24] reference frame with respect to
[22:57.92] this inertial reference frame where
[22:59.28] things were formulated
[23:07.60] what happens well we have to describe
[23:10.24] that change of variables and how we're
[23:11.76] going to do it well we're going to
[23:12.80] describe it this way today
[23:14.32] x prime the coordinates in the new
[23:15.92] reference frame are the
[23:17.84] coordinates in the old reference frame
[23:19.04] minus a half gt squared right we're just
[23:22.24] going to accelerate freely falling in
[23:23.76] the reference frame and t
[23:24.80] prime equals t we're not going to it's
[23:26.08] not relativity yet this is newtonian
[23:27.60] physics
[23:30.64] then what happens to the equations of
[23:32.16] motion according to newton in our new
[23:36.72] accelerating frame
[23:42.16] well if you do the change of variable i
[23:44.72] mean you know it's a little teeny weeny
[23:46.48] exercise
[23:48.00] all right literally substituting in for
[23:51.52] x
[23:51.76] prime here and t prime
[23:55.12] already leads you to the answer
[23:58.72] then we see that the equations of motion
[24:01.12] in this freely falling reference frame
[24:02.72] are exactly those of newton
[24:05.68] and we cannot detect that we're in a
[24:08.48] gravitational
[24:09.92] field so that's
[24:14.56] a uh the first demonstration within
[24:17.60] newton's theory
[24:18.64] of uff and eep
[24:24.48] now we're going to tell pretty much the
[24:26.00] same story
[24:29.20] but in special relativity
[24:34.32] a bit more demanding calculation and
[24:37.04] really a good warm up for you
[24:38.72] and a reminder and a check on your
[24:41.68] special relativity knowledge which is
[24:43.28] essential for this course
[24:47.52] so we're going to do essentially the
[24:50.72] same
[24:51.12] transformation we're going to go we're
[24:53.60] going to consider a particle moving
[24:55.44] under the influence of gravitational
[24:57.28] force field and in a freely folding
[24:59.84] coordinate system
[25:01.20] and then we're going to transform to a
[25:03.24] non-freely falling coordinate system and
[25:05.36] see what the equations of motion look
[25:06.72] like
[25:09.52] these kind of these these calculations
[25:11.92] are just
[25:12.56] meant to give you some facility with
[25:14.72] non-uh
[25:15.84] non-gala lane and non-lawrencium type
[25:17.84] changes of coordinates
[25:19.60] but along the lines along along the way
[25:21.68] we're going to see how
[25:22.88] the features how many of the symbols in
[25:25.36] differential geometry will already start
[25:26.88] to appear just
[25:28.00] in these simple simple calculations here
[25:31.28] so according to eep
[25:35.28] there exists for any particle
[25:41.28] moving purely under gravity
[25:58.24] purely under the influence of a
[25:59.68] gravitational field
[26:07.04] there exists for any such freely falling
[26:10.08] test particle there exists a coordinate
[26:12.16] system according to eep
[26:14.32] where you cannot detect the
[26:16.56] gravitational field
[26:19.28] at that point you can detect it by total
[26:21.68] forces but it's a little bit different
[26:43.68] so there exists a freely falling
[26:46.16] coordinate system and i'm going to write
[26:47.60] psi 0 through 3 to describe the
[26:50.16] coordinates in the system
[26:51.84] such that right there's no
[26:55.12] force acting on this particle
[26:58.64] now remember here we're doing now
[27:01.84] special relative special relativity this
[27:04.24] is relativistic
[27:05.44] dynamics and kinematics that we're
[27:06.96] talking about now
[27:09.12] and i have to highlight
[27:14.00] to remind you of some of the
[27:16.16] modifications you have to make to new
[27:17.52] training mechanics to do
[27:19.12] relativistic mechanics
[27:22.32] so where we've got something some new
[27:25.20] symbols here
[27:30.48] where tau is a new symbol this is the
[27:32.96] proper time right
[27:37.84] okay go go and revise the proper time
[27:40.96] you've seen it before in just about any
[27:43.44] special relativity course
[27:46.00] and how do you define the proper time
[27:54.32] well it's defined by the infinitesimal
[28:00.84] difference
[28:07.04] minus eta alpha beta dxi alpha d psi
[28:10.16] beta
[28:11.76] or or maybe it's a bit easier to see it
[28:14.24] this way
[28:15.44] it's defined by requiring that minus one
[28:20.80] is equal to eta alpha beta d psi
[28:23.84] alpha dt d tau sorry d psi
[28:27.04] beta d tau it's the the howard clock
[28:30.72] ticks that moves with the particle
[28:32.08] instantaneously
[28:34.64] and now now i've introduced some new
[28:36.32] notation right and some new
[28:37.76] new operations so we're going to have to
[28:39.44] explain these things
[28:40.96] so this is the new notations that we're
[28:42.96] encountering so firstly we've got
[28:44.64] here we've got this eta what on earth is
[28:46.96] ada a is a matrix
[28:49.04] it's a special relativity metric
[28:52.08] it's a diagonal matrix which is mostly
[28:54.24] positive in our course
[28:56.56] we'll take the mostly positive
[28:57.84] convention following walled
[29:00.40] and uh well you know
[29:03.68] i told you about components didn't i
[29:05.44] well the alpha beta component is also
[29:08.00] written
[29:09.76] like this which is the
[29:13.20] entry of row
[29:16.96] alpha and column beta
[29:22.00] we're also employing index notation to
[29:24.96] in the einstein summation convention
[29:27.92] so what does that mean well you've seen
[29:31.20] indices before
[29:33.44] in the previous lecture but the
[29:34.64] summation notation
[29:36.56] i mean you probably can't avoid you
[29:39.44] probably haven't been able to avoid
[29:40.80] seeing it so far but here it is just to
[29:42.48] remind you of it
[29:45.36] if we've got some an expression that
[29:46.80] looks like this this means
[29:49.12] some alpha 0 1 2
[29:52.84] 3 so wherever we have a repeated index
[29:56.64] where one index is
[29:57.68] downstairs and one index is upstairs
[30:00.40] then we're meant to sum over it
[30:02.08] the distinguishing distinction between
[30:03.92] downstairs and upstairs we won't make
[30:05.44] today
[30:06.80] today if you just see this notation this
[30:08.64] is what it means
[30:11.28] later as we get into differential
[30:12.80] geometry i will
[30:14.56] explain the difference between upstairs
[30:18.64] explain what the ups and down says
[30:20.72] notation is meant to represent
[30:23.12] so here we've just introduced a notation
[30:25.44] this should be already familiar to you
[30:27.04] from your special relativity course
[30:29.68] and and using that notation we've
[30:33.04] talked about or introduced the notion of
[30:34.56] proper time
[30:36.40] so proper time is
[30:39.92] tau is defined by this equation here so
[30:42.48] you get your coordinates
[30:44.56] and you differentiate them with respect
[30:46.40] to a temporal parameter
[30:48.32] and you find that temporal parameter or
[30:49.76] that premise parametrization of time
[30:51.44] such that that equation fulfilled with
[30:53.04] minus one is equal to this
[30:54.72] to this length of these four vectors
[30:56.24] here
[31:02.40] all right now that's
[31:05.60] in all in the free with respect to the
[31:07.12] freely falling reference frame right
[31:08.48] that's
[31:08.88] relativistic mechanics and freely
[31:10.56] falling reference frame there's no
[31:12.00] force forces and there's no force acting
[31:15.84] on on our test particle according to eep
[31:19.04] when we're in a 3d falling reference
[31:20.96] frame
[31:25.12] well let's suppose now we're going to
[31:27.60] take a look at things
[31:28.56] in another reference frame
[31:36.48] in fact we're going to be is pretty much
[31:37.84] as general as possible we're going to
[31:39.12] suppose we're going to move to a
[31:40.72] just another coordinate system
[31:44.24] it doesn't have to be accelera it
[31:46.56] doesn't have to be freely falling it
[31:47.92] might be
[31:48.56] uh static with respect to feeling
[31:51.04] falling
[31:51.68] uh observer it might be uh in constant
[31:54.40] motion with respect to feeling
[31:55.68] it might be rotating whatever this is a
[31:59.28] total general
[32:00.24] calculation might be a lab reference
[32:03.84] frame
[32:04.16] rotating
[32:07.28] so that's you know i'm going to just
[32:09.28] draw a schematic
[32:11.04] now of these coordinates
[32:14.16] so here this black grid here is meant to
[32:16.88] represent
[32:17.68] our uh our new coordinate system
[32:22.08] x1 goes along this this this axis here
[32:25.36] x naught which is something the temporal
[32:26.88] coordinate goes up there there's an x2
[32:28.48] and x3
[32:30.32] and then with respect to these new
[32:32.00] coordinates the old coordinates well
[32:33.68] they all look distorted don't they right
[32:35.44] you know maybe we're rotating who knows
[32:37.36] right
[32:39.84] here's the old coordinates here so this
[32:43.04] this
[32:43.44] this axis here might be psi naught in
[32:45.28] the old coordinates this one along here
[32:47.28] might be x i
[32:48.24] one so we have two coordinate systems
[32:52.16] one describing one reference frame one
[32:53.60] describing the other
[32:55.44] and how do we change coordinates well
[32:59.04] they're just functions of the other
[33:00.32] right so psi alpha
[33:02.56] you can express psi alpha the freely
[33:04.48] folding reference frame coordinates in
[33:06.08] terms of these non-freely falling
[33:07.76] reference frame coordinates
[33:09.04] you know as long as you didn't do
[33:09.92] anything singular
[33:12.16] this is a you you can calculate
[33:15.36] these coordinates so at the moment i've
[33:18.24] got these upstairs indices
[33:19.60] don't worry about that yet just follow
[33:21.60] the notation and
[33:22.96] the meaning will be explained later you
[33:25.60] can you could eventually wells written
[33:27.36] all these indices downstairs if you want
[33:29.04] at the moment there's no no
[33:30.96] no difference in their meaning implied
[33:36.16] so the force-free equation of motion you
[33:38.96] know the
[33:39.60] the the expression of relativist in
[33:42.24] relativistic mechanics that no force
[33:43.92] acts
[33:49.28] what does that look like well remember
[33:51.52] the force-free equation which
[33:52.88] is no force zero no force acts
[33:56.16] on d squared x i alpha d
[33:59.28] tau squared right proper times up there
[34:01.68] let's go check i didn't write nonsense
[34:03.44] down here is that the same as before yep
[34:06.40] so but that's in the freely fooling
[34:08.16] reference frame what does it look like
[34:09.36] in our crazy reference frame
[34:11.84] well we've got to substitute
[34:14.96] and what does two second derivative mean
[34:17.04] it means do the derivative twice
[34:18.88] so we're going to do it twice
[34:23.28] but remember we've got to do everything
[34:24.56] with respect to our new coordinate
[34:25.84] system
[34:26.32] so we have to take this total derivative
[34:29.20] with respect to proper time
[34:30.56] and express it with respect to
[34:33.76] the coordinate system
[34:37.76] coordinates x mu
[34:44.64] right there we go all i've done is taken
[34:46.56] this total derivative
[34:47.68] and written it in terms of all the
[34:48.88] partials with respect to the
[34:50.96] independent variables
[34:55.04] and now well that's just one total
[34:57.28] derivative we need to get rid of the
[34:58.64] other one
[34:59.12] in the same fashion and if you do this
[35:01.44] you find the following equation
[35:03.84] for the false free equation of motion
[35:09.20] so if you apply the second derivative
[35:11.44] and write the total derivative with
[35:12.88] respect to all the independent variables
[35:14.72] as partial derivatives
[35:17.84] then you end up with this equation here
[35:27.04] and this is an equation that we will see
[35:29.36] a lot more
[35:31.44] in coming lectures
[35:34.64] it's called the geodesic equation but
[35:37.36] here we're just doing things totally
[35:39.04] at a completely elementary level within
[35:41.04] relativistic mechanics
[35:44.64] so already this is a an interesting
[35:46.80] equation it's not
[35:47.68] completely the geodesic equation right
[35:49.44] you know we've got this
[35:51.84] we've got a term here and we don't like
[35:53.36] that we want to express things in a term
[35:55.28] which makes
[35:56.08] in a way which makes the acceleration
[35:57.76] terms
[36:00.24] easier to look at and so we want to get
[36:02.16] rid of this yellow term
[36:03.36] um we can do that
[36:06.88] zero equals this complicated equation we
[36:09.76] can
[36:10.08] exploit the following you know identity
[36:12.72] namely that the
[36:13.92] jacobian is invertible
[36:23.20] d lambda mu is just the dirac delta
[36:26.32] chronic delta function to get direct the
[36:28.24] chronic delta function so it's one if
[36:30.24] lambda equals mu or zero otherwise so
[36:33.28] this is just
[36:34.24] this is the jacobian matrix is
[36:36.08] invertible that's what that says
[36:39.60] so then if we can exploit that we can
[36:41.28] multiply both sides
[36:48.72] we can multiply both sides by dx lambda
[36:52.64] dxi alpha to eliminate this yellow term
[36:55.68] there
[36:57.12] and sum right and sum
[37:01.28] and then that equation up here now
[37:04.40] takes on the more familiar geodesic
[37:06.72] equation type
[37:11.84] form and i've already introduced
[37:15.84] some notation that we'll see later when
[37:18.24] we start doing differential geometry
[37:20.84] properly
[37:24.16] so this is what the equation of motion
[37:25.36] looks like in our new reference frame
[37:29.44] our crazy rotating jumping up and down
[37:32.00] on the trampoline reference frame
[37:33.60] this is what the the freely falling
[37:36.32] trajectory looks like
[37:38.00] and we've introduced some notation
[37:48.80] gamma for the so-called affine
[37:51.12] connection
[38:02.32] and this is
[38:05.36] well it's okay i've missed one line so
[38:07.68] it's an exercise for you to fill in that
[38:09.12] line
[38:14.00] and this is this affine connection
[38:17.04] expresses the
[38:20.64] how how the
[38:23.84] the new coordinate the old the freely
[38:26.80] falling coordinates depend on the
[38:28.72] the new coordinate system and there's
[38:30.08] also a jacobian factor in there
[38:37.12] and we can also okay so let's pause for
[38:40.88] a moment to just
[38:42.40] look at this equation here we're going
[38:44.40] to see this equation much more
[38:45.84] generality
[38:46.72] when we come to formulating differential
[38:48.56] geometry mathematically
[38:50.64] and this equation we know is the
[38:52.16] geodesic equation and
[38:53.84] it expresses that in a
[38:56.96] freely falling reference frame there are
[39:00.16] no forces acting on a particle
[39:03.12] okay eep
[39:09.52] it's convenient you know when we're in
[39:11.20] the new reference frame it's a bit
[39:12.48] convenient to not have to define the
[39:14.48] proper time with respect to the old
[39:16.24] reference frame coordinates so what we
[39:18.48] do is we also
[39:19.52] work out how to com to calculate the
[39:22.40] proper time with respect to
[39:23.92] uh with respect to the new coordinates
[39:35.04] that way we're not we're not stuck to
[39:37.68] going to the freely falling reference
[39:38.96] frame every time we want to compute
[39:40.08] something
[39:41.44] the tau squared what is it equal to by
[39:43.28] per definition it's equal to eta alpha
[39:45.20] beta
[39:45.76] d psi alpha d psi beta
[39:49.52] well let's just change our coordinates
[39:51.36] now we know how to change coordinates we
[39:53.36] just change our total derivatives
[39:55.20] with respect to size to partial
[39:58.08] derivatives with respect to
[39:59.60] x's we do some multi-variable calculus
[40:03.92] to do the increment in terms of x's
[40:07.60] instead of
[40:08.84] size
[40:24.32] there we go that's how we change from
[40:26.32] having our
[40:29.12] increment d psi to dx we pick up these
[40:32.88] change of variable formulas and
[40:36.08] we can define that way a new expression
[40:43.44] we could just define something called g
[40:45.68] g is a matrix
[40:47.04] and that's that g collects together all
[40:49.68] the stuff that turned out
[40:51.52] appeared when we changed to the new
[40:54.32] coordinate system
[40:55.44] this is the blue stuff
[41:02.80] so the definition of g
[41:06.24] is as d psi alpha d x
[41:09.60] mu d x i beta d x nu
[41:16.00] is the and we give a name to it right we
[41:18.80] call it the metric
[41:25.04] so these are just this is these are
[41:27.04] calculations you can do within newton's
[41:29.52] mechanics newtonian mechanics or
[41:30.88] relativistic mechanics
[41:33.68] where we explore consequences
[41:37.20] of eep and uff and so on
[41:42.88] this doesn't completely get us to
[41:46.24] general relativity here we're only
[41:47.68] seeing
[41:48.00] one aspect of general relativity a very
[41:51.44] important aspect
[41:52.24] namely that the geometry of space time
[41:54.72] tells freely pulling particles how to
[41:56.64] move
[41:58.64] the geometry of space time will be later
[42:00.88] captured in this course
[42:02.00] by the metric g mu u g mu will be all
[42:04.72] that you need to describe the geometry
[42:06.32] of space time
[42:07.28] and with that you'll be able to derive
[42:09.04] the trajectories of freely falling
[42:10.64] particles
[42:11.52] but that's only half the story right
[42:13.28] general relativity is an amazing theory
[42:15.84] because it combines a back action
[42:20.88] of of matter on the gravitational field
[42:23.92] and that's
[42:27.04] comes as a consequence not just of eep
[42:29.44] also also of
[42:31.12] something called mark's principle
[42:37.20] this is the second underlying
[42:44.40] the second key idea underlying here
[42:56.40] and it's a bit more diffuse it's a bit
[42:58.32] harder to make
[42:59.60] precise but it was highly influential to
[43:01.52] einstein
[43:05.36] and so in second key idea well really we
[43:07.28] should replace the word idea with
[43:09.92] circle of ideas set of ideas
[43:20.32] it's less precise you can't formulate it
[43:23.92] so nicely
[43:26.56] but very very influential
[43:33.84] i'll give a summary of these ideas in
[43:35.84] the following statement it's a modern
[43:40.56] interpretation of what marx
[43:42.16] and smoke was all about
[44:26.88] and this summary is something like this
[44:28.80] all matter in the universe
[44:30.24] should contribute to the local
[44:32.08] definition of non-accelerating and
[44:34.84] non-rotating
[44:36.80] conversely
[44:38.04] [Music]
[44:40.64] in a universe devoid of matter
[44:49.04] there should be no meaning to these
[45:02.84] concepts
[45:04.08] and this is really pretty deep right you
[45:05.84] know these concepts don't make sense
[45:10.16] without matter you need matter to give
[45:12.48] sense to
[45:13.68] the notion of non-acceleration and
[45:16.84] non-rotating
[45:19.44] now einstein took these ideas and these
[45:22.08] observations and these calculations and
[45:24.00] similar
[45:25.28] similar calculations to these and over
[45:29.04] a long period of time
[45:32.24] conceived of and carried out the
[45:35.20] formulation
[45:36.40] of the theory that we now know today as
[45:38.08] general relativity
[45:41.36] i'm going to give you a short
[45:45.20] description of general relativity as
[45:47.44] formulated by einstein
[45:52.24] it's possible to to state what the
[45:54.32] theory is even
[45:55.52] at this quite descriptive level but
[45:58.40] getting at the quantitative
[46:01.04] consequences of these statements takes a
[46:03.52] lot more work
[46:04.80] but nonetheless you can still appreciate
[46:06.96] einstein's theory with
[46:08.32] little more than what i've shown you in
[46:09.76] these first two lectures
[47:04.00] so the first part of general relativity
[47:05.76] is a statement that the observer
[47:07.28] independent properties
[47:08.56] of space-time are described by a
[47:10.56] space-time metric
[47:11.84] which is a matrix of four numbers at
[47:13.60] every space-time location
[47:15.04] which need not have the platform or
[47:16.64] special relativity okay
[47:19.92] now comes
[47:23.12] the byte curvature is that property of
[47:26.48] the metric
[47:27.44] that accounts for the physical effects
[47:30.80] of gravitation
[47:46.48] so that's the first part
[47:49.52] of the second part of the formulation
[47:51.20] general relativity curvature
[47:52.96] is a property of the metric so you can
[47:54.88] spec first
[47:56.08] statement is that space time is
[47:57.76] described by a space like metric
[47:59.92] second part is that the property of this
[48:02.00] metric field
[48:03.68] that accounts for the physical effects
[48:05.04] of gravitation is curvature which i'll
[48:06.96] come to defining in the coming
[48:09.68] say three or four weeks
[48:12.72] and further
[48:18.64] and in a sense you know you could
[48:20.24] discover already the statement that
[48:21.68] curvature is effect accounting for the
[48:23.20] physical effects of gravitation that's
[48:24.96] uh from calculations we've done today
[48:27.68] but
[48:29.12] the part that we haven't really
[48:30.16] discussed today and we will discuss
[48:34.08] later is that curvature is determined
[48:39.68] itself by matter
[48:51.60] well not really just matter actually
[48:54.24] matters perhaps uh
[48:56.48] over simplifying it curvature is
[48:58.32] determined by the distribution of
[49:00.16] stress energy and momentum
[49:04.96] in space-time and therefore
[49:08.16] and then vice versa so there's this
[49:10.24] continuous interplay
[49:11.92] between the distribution of stress
[49:15.44] energy which affects the curvature
[49:19.28] of space-time curvature affects the
[49:21.84] locations
[49:22.88] of test particles or test masses and
[49:26.48] test masses are masses right a part is
[49:29.44] matter itself
[49:30.88] curvature tells matter how to move on
[49:32.64] these freely falling geodesics
[49:34.16] which then redefines what it means for
[49:36.08] the the distribution of stress and
[49:37.84] uh redefines this distribution of stress
[49:40.40] energy which changes the curvature and
[49:41.84] so on
[49:44.32] and so this
[49:53.92] so stress energy
[49:57.12] uh tell space time how to move and
[49:59.44] curvature tells how
[50:01.60] tells how mata moves so there's this
[50:04.32] non-linear
[50:05.12] it'll turn out to be non-linear
[50:06.88] interplay between these two concepts
[50:08.64] they determine each other
[50:10.40] and the extraordinary thing that the
[50:12.56] almost divine aspect of general
[50:14.32] relativity is that this holds together
[50:16.08] it doesn't
[50:16.72] blow to pieces and become inconsistent
[50:19.76] this leads to a beautifully consistent
[50:21.60] theory a complete
[50:23.20] theory of essentially of itself
[50:26.24] and that's an amazing thing that you
[50:28.48] that such a thing could exist
[50:29.76] especially when you you work at trying
[50:31.44] to build these kinds of theories
[50:33.20] and you find that it's not so trivial to
[50:34.88] come up with something like that that
[50:36.00] all holds together
[50:37.60] well that's the that's a story for
[50:40.00] another
[50:40.80] let's say 20 lectures so the plan is
[50:44.16] this is your first two lectures of
[50:45.60] general relativity you've seen
[50:47.60] uh the key principles underlying the
[50:49.44] formulation of general relativity
[50:51.52] you've seen the einstein's equivalence
[50:54.32] principle we've seen mark's principle
[50:55.76] we've done some calculations and moving
[50:57.36] between reference frames
[50:58.96] but actually implementing carrying out
[51:01.20] the physical content
[51:02.48] of einstein's formulation of general
[51:04.08] relativity
[51:05.68] it's not sufficient really to with the
[51:07.28] maths that we have currently
[51:08.72] at our disposal we have to develop the
[51:10.72] mathematics of
[51:11.76] of curvature the mathematics of of
[51:14.88] space-time manifolds that aren't flat
[51:18.48] and that requires a bit of work without
[51:21.84] work you don't you can't expect any
[51:23.44] payoff
[51:24.24] you only get what you put into it in
[51:25.68] this course and that's the work that
[51:27.20] we're going to commence next week
[51:28.80] in lecture three but for now that's it
[51:31.44] thank you very much
[51:32.48] goodbye
