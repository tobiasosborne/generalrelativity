[00:00.16] g'day my name is tobias osborne welcome
[00:02.72] to introduction to general relativity
[00:04.96] i'm looking forward to you joining me on
[00:07.20] this journey through physics most
[00:08.72] elegant and beautiful of theories
[00:11.28] i vividly recall the lecture in my first
[00:14.40] year physics
[00:15.20] degree where i first encountered general
[00:17.28] relativity
[00:18.48] at the time i was strongly contemplating
[00:20.72] a move to computer science
[00:22.32] but after that lecture i was hooked i
[00:24.72] remember being amazed at the connection
[00:26.64] between the curvature of space-time and
[00:28.64] the motion of freely falling bodies
[00:32.64] this is really the subject that drew me
[00:34.32] into physics in the first place
[00:36.40] it's not the one that kept me here but
[00:38.08] it's certainly the one that drew me to
[00:39.44] him
[00:40.72] and i'm looking forward to teaching you
[00:42.64] this most amazing and elegant of
[00:45.04] theories
[00:46.00] it's really no exaggeration that
[00:49.04] physicists regard general relativity as
[00:51.28] one of the most beautiful
[00:52.72] physical theories that we have the words
[00:56.00] elegant
[00:57.12] and beautiful very appropriately
[01:00.72] describe the theory of general
[01:02.32] relativity indeed there's somehow an
[01:04.24] element of the divine
[01:05.76] in the way that general relativity works
[01:08.16] and holds together
[01:10.24] and i'm very much looking forward to
[01:12.48] sharing all of this with you in the
[01:14.00] coming course
[01:16.00] but i should say before we go too much
[01:18.08] into this course
[01:19.60] it must be said that general relativity
[01:21.36] is wrong
[01:22.96] it's wrong because as far as we know it
[01:25.52] does is not
[01:26.32] compatible with the theory of quantum
[01:28.40] mechanics or at least
[01:30.08] not in a way that's compelling so we
[01:33.36] need to correct
[01:34.32] or find a deeper more underlying theory
[01:38.24] for the the physics of nature itself
[01:41.36] nonetheless even though general
[01:42.80] relativity is wrong
[01:44.40] it has proven to be spectacularly
[01:46.08] successful in almost all cosmological
[01:48.88] uh areas the predictions of general
[01:51.76] relativity have been
[01:53.12] confirmed to an extraordinary level of
[01:55.12] degree of accuracy
[01:58.48] what's the format of this lecture so
[02:00.80] this lecture series will cover some
[02:03.04] 10 to 13 weeks there will be
[02:05.44] approximately two lectures a week
[02:07.60] i will record the videos for the
[02:09.44] lectures it will be presented
[02:10.72] asynchronously and i will upload the
[02:12.64] lectures
[02:13.28] usually on monday or tuesday in the week
[02:17.92] for students at the leibniz university
[02:20.48] of hanover
[02:21.44] you can find all information regarding
[02:23.84] the organization
[02:25.36] and the examination requirements for
[02:27.36] this course
[02:28.48] on the study p webpage
[02:35.36] there will be a textbook that i will be
[02:37.52] following for this course the textbook
[02:39.36] will be that of
[02:40.24] uh wald this is world's
[02:43.60] general relativity textbook
[02:52.40] this is world's general relativity
[02:54.08] textbook that we will be following
[02:56.00] in this course
[02:59.12] um however i won't be following it to
[03:01.92] the page
[03:02.64] or the letter and i will deviate
[03:05.76] occasionally
[03:06.56] indeed straight away from the book to
[03:08.96] introduce
[03:09.84] material from other sources i think it's
[03:12.40] worth mentioning
[03:13.92] uh two two sources in particular that i
[03:16.72] will be
[03:22.24] i will spend i i will consult for
[03:25.12] additional material
[03:27.04] there's the so-called telephone book
[03:30.72] messenger thorne and wheeler
[03:33.04] this massive book is a fantastic
[03:35.68] discussion
[03:36.72] of general aspects of general relativity
[03:39.04] i will certainly be consulting
[03:43.28] this book on occasion and also
[03:46.08] weinberg's gravitation and cosmology
[03:48.80] is really a fantastic resource for
[03:50.72] explicit calculations
[03:54.24] now the presentation or the rather the
[03:58.00] structure of this course
[04:01.20] the emphasis in this course will be over
[04:03.28] mathematical methods
[04:04.88] over the physics so
[04:08.32] my ultimate goal
[04:12.08] is to introduce to you the mathematics
[04:16.40] and the mathematical methods underlying
[04:18.72] general relativity of course i will
[04:21.52] not be neglecting the physics and i will
[04:24.32] be
[04:24.64] indeed spending a long time talking
[04:27.60] about
[04:28.08] the physical basis for the general
[04:29.84] relativity but it is certainly my goal
[04:33.12] to spend a long time introducing you to
[04:35.68] the mathematical methods of general
[04:37.60] relativity
[04:38.56] and there's multiple reasons why one
[04:40.48] might want to do that
[04:42.32] although i mean you can discuss general
[04:44.40] relativity
[04:45.44] practically without ever really
[04:48.08] seriously getting in delving into
[04:49.60] differential geometry
[04:50.96] you can work most of the time with one
[04:53.36] coordinate patch as we'll see
[04:54.96] in one coordinate system you can talk
[04:57.12] about the motion
[04:58.40] of particles in a curve space time
[05:01.52] without making reference to geodesic
[05:04.00] equations in coordinate free notation
[05:05.76] blah blah blah
[05:06.88] we can do general relativity in a very
[05:09.28] concrete and explicit way
[05:10.80] you will certainly find references and
[05:12.16] resources where that's the case
[05:14.32] however i do want to spend some time
[05:17.20] getting you familiar with the
[05:18.32] mathematical methods of general
[05:19.68] relativity
[05:20.72] in particular the mathematical methods
[05:22.80] of differential geometry
[05:25.20] for many of you this is the first time
[05:27.68] you will see
[05:29.12] differential geometry and uh and
[05:32.32] use these tools in earnest differential
[05:34.96] geometry
[05:35.68] isn't really necessary to describe much
[05:38.16] of the phenomenon physics
[05:39.84] the up to now in your your degree in
[05:42.16] your studies of physics
[05:43.60] however you will find that if you want
[05:45.92] to go further in physics
[05:48.08] that it underlies multiple
[05:52.32] it underlies multiple uh current
[05:54.40] research areas in
[05:56.24] in physics and most most notably
[05:59.92] anytime you want to do anything with
[06:01.36] quantum gravity and string theory
[06:04.80] you'd better be sure
[06:08.00] that you are up to date with your
[06:11.44] differential geometry knowledge and also
[06:15.04] uh the the basic methods theorems and
[06:18.16] results from differential geometry
[06:20.32] so that's why we're going to spend a lot
[06:22.32] of time in this course
[06:23.60] building this theory up the theory isn't
[06:26.40] in all of its
[06:27.20] its breadth and depth isn't strictly
[06:28.88] needed to describe most of
[06:30.72] the content of general relativity
[06:32.48] however you will need it for any further
[06:35.36] studies in physics and certainly if you
[06:37.60] wish to pursue a research career in
[06:39.44] physics
[06:40.08] a knowledge of differential geometry can
[06:41.68] do no wrong
[06:43.44] i should mention that there's some
[06:46.16] additional resources
[06:48.16] there's
[06:51.68] perhaps my favorite video reference
[06:54.48] would be the
[06:55.28] videos of lenny suskin on general
[06:56.88] relativity uh do check them out he has
[06:59.76] an absolutely different perspective to
[07:01.36] the perspective
[07:02.00] that i'll be presenting here and i would
[07:03.36] say completely complementary perspective
[07:05.36] to the perspective i'm presenting here
[07:08.16] so do check out
[07:09.12] lenny suskin's videos on general
[07:10.88] relativity
[07:14.56] so that's it for the basic
[07:16.00] organizational uh
[07:17.76] announcements for this course from now
[07:20.88] on
[07:21.44] we will be commencing
[07:24.80] our studies of einstein's theory of
[07:27.44] general relativity
[07:29.44] and in particular we're going to
[07:31.76] commence
[07:32.72] today in lecture one with
[07:35.84] pre-relativity gravitation
[07:42.48] so how is it is a short review
[07:46.48] of gravitation the theory of gravitation
[07:50.64] before relativity
[07:55.36] before the uh it was combined with a
[07:57.84] theory of relativity
[07:59.04] by einstein now i should point out
[08:02.48] that i'm assuming before i go on i
[08:05.36] realize i should point out
[08:06.80] that i'm going to assume some prior
[08:08.32] knowledge i'm going to assume
[08:10.16] that you know in particular there's one
[08:12.56] thing i really assume
[08:13.84] and that is that you've you've
[08:16.48] self-studied or you've seen a course or
[08:18.24] you've participated in a course on
[08:19.84] special relativity
[08:21.52] this is really vital i will not pause
[08:24.64] to review most of the concepts of
[08:26.96] special relativity we're going to go
[08:28.16] straight in
[08:29.28] and be discussing all aspects of general
[08:32.64] relativity
[08:34.08] without too much review of the special
[08:36.80] relativity foundations
[08:38.40] do make sure you know this stuff you can
[08:40.56] get this in a multitude of places now
[08:42.72] videos
[08:43.36] books tutorials um if you speak german
[08:46.40] then you can certainly take a look at my
[08:48.56] tv show physique ah videos in particular
[08:51.52] the last
[08:52.08] couple of videos in that course
[08:55.44] i gave an introduction to special
[08:57.84] relativity actually
[08:59.28] it's probably the material i discussed
[09:00.88] there would be sufficient
[09:03.28] basis for this course furthermore i'm
[09:05.92] going to assume a little bit more
[09:07.28] i'm going to assume that you know
[09:08.32] calculus
[09:10.72] that that's extremely vital we can't do
[09:13.12] calculus or manifolds if we don't know
[09:14.72] calculus you've got to know that
[09:16.64] learn that and also it's vital that you
[09:19.28] know linear algebra
[09:23.36] in physics a knowledge of calculus and
[09:26.00] linear algebra is absolutely essential
[09:28.24] there's a hidden fourth
[09:33.12] prerequisite in all the physical courses
[09:36.24] and that's the subject of combinatorics
[09:40.00] unless you're doing some kind of hard
[09:41.44] combinatorics at the end you probably
[09:42.80] haven't done any science so it's vital
[09:44.80] that you also are familiar with some
[09:46.32] basic notions from combinatorics
[09:48.08] counting things pigeonhole principles
[09:50.32] that can't hurt we won't explicitly use
[09:52.56] these techniques
[09:53.36] in this course but there will be
[09:54.48] occasion that sometimes our problems
[09:56.16] will reduce the counting problems
[09:58.64] so these are the three core
[10:00.24] prerequisites make sure you know your
[10:01.60] calculus
[10:02.32] well fundamental theorem of calculus
[10:04.32] multivariable calculus you need to know
[10:05.92] how to change variables
[10:07.12] in a multi-dimensional integral you need
[10:10.00] to know linear algebra
[10:11.36] do you know what a matrix is as a linear
[10:13.60] mapping how do what's an eigenvalue
[10:15.36] what's an eigenvector
[10:16.56] make sure you know that stuff and
[10:18.40] combinatorics to the extent that you
[10:20.16] know about basic counting
[10:22.00] finite sets perhaps finite graphs these
[10:25.52] prerequisites are vital we can't i would
[10:28.00] suggest that you pause this video right
[10:29.68] now
[10:30.08] and make sure you're familiar with these
[10:31.44] things
[10:33.44] before listening on all right let's get
[10:36.80] started
[10:37.44] with a quick overview today
[10:40.56] on gravity pre-relativity
[10:45.20] so we'll start with the underlying
[10:48.24] assumption of
[10:49.20] newtonian physics so
[10:53.76] gravity pre einstein was
[10:56.96] that of newton and in
[11:00.80] newtonian physics one can uh summarize
[11:03.92] or
[11:06.24] quantify or extract the fundamental
[11:09.04] assumptions underlying
[11:10.40] newtonian physics and the underlying
[11:13.28] assumption
[11:14.64] that we will break and so this is really
[11:16.80] a a common thread in all of physics
[11:19.84] is that one makes assumptions or
[11:22.32] implicitly makes assumptions
[11:23.76] in physical theories and that as one
[11:25.92] learns more about the universe one is
[11:27.52] forced to
[11:28.16] re-evaluate and potentially change or
[11:30.64] break these assumptions and that's
[11:32.00] certainly the case
[11:32.88] in the development of general relativity
[11:35.28] and the core assumption
[11:36.48] that will be broken in the transition
[11:39.84] from
[11:40.40] pre-relativity to relativity physics is
[11:43.04] that of the assumption of the existence
[11:45.28] of a preferred reference frame
[11:48.32] so in newtonian physics underlying it
[11:50.80] all
[11:51.76] is the assumption of the existence of a
[11:55.04] preferred
[11:58.08] reference frame of or reference
[12:01.60] system not only
[12:05.04] of of rulers
[12:08.24] but also um clocks
[12:14.08] so i'll just say a preferred reference
[12:15.68] system
[12:17.20] and clocks
[12:20.88] so this is the assumption
[12:24.08] of newtonian physics in newtonian
[12:27.28] physics we assume the existence of a
[12:28.80] preferred reference system
[12:30.08] and clocks
[12:33.28] and we could denote or draw such a
[12:36.24] reference system
[12:38.56] something like this three coordinate
[12:41.44] axes
[12:43.68] and we would call this system
[12:47.60] inertial so this this reference system
[12:50.56] is preferred
[12:53.04] and inertial if the trajectories
[12:57.12] of a finite test mass or free test mass
[13:00.64] let's say
[13:01.36] upon which no force acts moves along a
[13:03.44] straight line
[13:09.04] so i'll highlight that here
[13:16.08] in this particular preferred reference
[13:17.92] frame free test masses
[13:22.48] so it's important to say that free means
[13:25.04] no force acts
[13:29.20] that these move along a straight
[13:34.88] trajectory
[13:45.04] and do they move along the straight
[13:46.24] trajectory at a non-constant rate node
[13:48.08] they move along the straight
[13:49.36] trajectory at a constant rate and the
[13:52.08] clocks
[13:54.96] they tick at a constant rate in this
[13:56.64] preferred reference frame
[14:06.48] so in particular this means a constant
[14:08.48] displacement per unit time
[14:12.96] and this is in a so-called inertial
[14:16.32] reference frame
[14:18.00] or indeed inertial reference frames are
[14:20.80] defined
[14:24.56] with respect to this property that free
[14:26.56] test masses move on straight
[14:27.92] trajectories at constant rates
[14:32.08] there is one preferred reference frame a
[14:34.40] system in clocks but you can get other
[14:35.84] ones by making so-called galilean boosts
[14:39.44] if you move a constant velocity with
[14:40.88] respect to this preferred reference
[14:42.08] flame then you will also
[14:43.44] note that all three test masses move
[14:46.64] along straight trajectories at a
[14:48.16] constant rate uniformly in time
[14:51.36] and now is the moment to recall
[14:54.64] newton's second law
[14:59.12] which tells us the trajectory or how to
[15:01.20] calculate the trajectories
[15:02.64] of particles in such reference frame
[15:06.24] and it's written with respect
[15:11.20] to an inertial reference system as
[15:16.64] the following
[15:20.24] so with respect to
[15:24.84] um an inertial
[15:31.12] reference system
[15:34.40] so just remember
[15:37.68] this formulation of newtonian mechanics
[15:49.04] namely the acceleration of the test mass
[15:52.16] or test particle
[15:54.16] is determined by the force acting on it
[15:58.08] so f here this is more for notation sake
[16:01.20] f is denotes the force force is a three
[16:03.28] vector here
[16:04.80] m i denotes the so-called inertial mass
[16:07.52] of the particle
[16:09.92] and x double dot is the acceleration
[16:15.20] of the test particle so this is newton's
[16:18.56] second law
[16:19.44] underlying newtonian physics
[16:25.84] now interestingly you can write this is
[16:28.16] all with respect to an inertial
[16:29.44] reference frame
[16:30.88] but you can write the equations of
[16:33.60] motions with respect to
[16:34.96] non-inertial reference frames
[16:38.96] and that's a key
[16:44.72] this is something we're going to do a
[16:46.00] lot
[16:49.04] in general relativity because we're
[16:50.56] going to have test masses moving in
[16:52.80] in gravitational fields gravitational
[16:55.28] fields induce acceleration so with
[16:56.96] respect to say static lab-based
[16:58.64] reference frames
[17:00.16] where particles will move on uh
[17:03.44] they will be falling and accelerating
[17:05.36] but with respect to the accelerating
[17:06.96] reference frame of a
[17:08.16] freely falling test mass things will
[17:09.60] look different
[17:11.44] so with respect to non-inertial
[17:13.28] reference system
[17:16.84] frame
[17:22.96] we can also write out newton's equations
[17:26.40] newton's second law there's no
[17:27.60] difficulty in doing this
[17:29.44] and how do we do this well we
[17:32.48] we introduce some unit vectors
[17:37.52] this is one way of doing it we can do it
[17:39.04] another way in the next lecture
[17:40.72] so we define three unit vectors
[17:50.56] and we'll call them x hat prime
[17:53.60] and the thing about these unit vectors x
[17:55.28] hat prime t
[17:57.12] is that they change with time
[18:00.64] so they describe the unit vectors with
[18:03.44] respect to
[18:04.16] a moving accelerating reference frame so
[18:06.88] they hear the three unit vectors that
[18:08.32] we're going to use to describe things in
[18:10.08] our accelerating or non-inertial
[18:12.32] reference frame
[18:15.60] so we introduce these three unit vectors
[18:17.36] x prime y prime z
[18:18.64] prime we assume that the orthonormal
[18:22.48] and in an inertial
[18:25.52] reference frame determined sorry in a
[18:28.48] non-inertial right
[18:30.73] [Music]
[18:33.36] frame determined by these vectors then
[18:36.16] trajectories of straight lines might
[18:38.08] look curved because if you're
[18:39.44] accelerating with respect to
[18:41.04] an inertial reference frame the
[18:42.48] trajectory of a free
[18:45.12] test mass won't look straight anymore
[18:48.00] you're accelerating
[18:51.20] so in a reference frame with respect
[18:54.40] to this basis
[19:02.72] let's start it off in our old reference
[19:08.84] frame
[19:12.24] so if we go back to our initial
[19:15.68] inertial reference frame let's go back
[19:18.00] up here i've drawn it here
[19:19.20] then one can introduce the unit vectors
[19:22.96] pointing along the coordinate axis as x
[19:25.20] hat y hat and z hat these
[19:27.12] are the original unit vectors so in the
[19:30.08] reference
[19:30.56] with respect to the old basis
[19:35.12] we can write the trajectory
[19:38.40] of the test mass as we can decompose it
[19:41.36] with respect to these three unit vectors
[19:42.80] so we have w
[19:43.68] x w x is the coordinate
[19:47.20] component in the x direction of the
[19:50.64] displacement vector of this test mass w
[19:54.00] y it's also the y component so on blah
[19:56.40] blah blah
[19:57.28] w z
[20:00.64] and uh and fine so we've described with
[20:03.44] these three numbers the trajectory
[20:05.68] of a of a particle with respect to an
[20:08.00] inertial reference frame
[20:09.76] these are just the coordinates
[20:16.96] but of course we want to describe things
[20:19.28] with respect to
[20:20.00] our new reference frame how do we do
[20:21.84] that well
[20:23.60] we just write everything
[20:26.80] in terms of this new basis it's a it's a
[20:29.28] moving basis this basis moves in time
[20:31.44] okay remember these
[20:34.40] x y's and z's are vectors okay one short
[20:37.04] aside on notation
[20:40.64] i use um
[20:46.84] notation
[20:48.80] i use the underline to denote a 3 vector
[20:53.12] or even a 4 vector this just denotes a
[20:55.76] vector
[21:00.08] if you've watched any of my other videos
[21:01.68] or been through any of my other courses
[21:03.52] you'll you'll probably be familiar with
[21:04.88] this notation
[21:05.60] i tend to use lowercase letters to
[21:07.44] denote vectors
[21:08.88] uh then matrices
[21:12.16] i put three two lines underneath
[21:17.20] so a matrix times by a vector looks
[21:20.40] something like
[21:21.52] this tend to use that notation but that
[21:25.28] i'm not going to use a three-line
[21:26.48] notation for tensors i think that's
[21:27.92] ridiculous for some reason
[21:29.44] and so we're not going to be doing that
[21:31.12] tenses will always be clear from context
[21:33.68] when we introduce them like i'm not
[21:35.12] expecting that you know what a tensor is
[21:37.44] um that's something we're going to
[21:39.20] introduce in this course
[21:40.80] i i won't use underline notation
[21:49.04] so if you're watching this again for
[21:50.88] review i won't be using this underline
[21:53.44] notation instead we'll probably that
[21:55.44] will have shifted over to index notation
[21:57.36] by that point
[21:58.00] here also i should
[22:01.76] pause to mention index notation
[22:05.76] also something that you should have
[22:07.12] picked up in a special relativity course
[22:09.84] or
[22:10.24] even indeed a reasonably advanced course
[22:12.80] of mechanics
[22:14.48] we refer to elements of vectors and
[22:17.04] matrices with the
[22:18.16] also with index notation so if we have a
[22:20.64] vector a
[22:21.84] then we can denote the x component
[22:25.12] of a
[22:30.56] with a square brackets and an x or
[22:34.00] we might write it as ax
[22:40.08] similarly for matrices
[22:43.76] if i have the x y component of a matrix
[22:50.72] then i'm also going to use the notation
[22:53.12] x subscript x y
[22:55.60] probably in fact very quickly we're
[22:58.24] going to see
[22:58.88] that when we move to relativity physics
[23:00.48] i'll be putting that index upstairs as
[23:02.24] well we'll explain the upstairs notation
[23:04.08] when we get there
[23:06.80] so there it is that's some notations
[23:08.72] that we're going to be using when we're
[23:10.08] expressing
[23:10.96] uh vector quantities in newtonian
[23:13.68] physics and certainly we're going to
[23:15.28] this notation will transition to the
[23:17.36] relativity world
[23:18.96] as well all right so there's
[23:22.08] if we go back to here what was our goal
[23:23.44] well we have a trajectory
[23:28.88] with respect to an inertial reference
[23:30.96] frame but we can also express that
[23:32.16] trajectory with respect to a
[23:33.44] non-inertial reference frame
[23:35.12] as soon as we've chosen a
[23:38.96] set of unit vectors for the
[23:42.88] non-inertial reference frame no problems
[23:45.04] there that's a it's a little
[23:47.04] linear algebra computation
[23:53.04] and when you do that so suppose you
[23:56.24] insist on working with respect to a
[23:57.76] non-inertial reference frame
[23:59.28] well just substitute this stuff into
[24:01.20] here this stuff here into newton's
[24:03.04] second law and then you'll see that you
[24:04.48] get
[24:04.88] that newton's second law looks different
[24:09.44] so we're going to that's a homework
[24:10.96] question also we'll see it in the next
[24:12.24] lecture anyway
[24:13.52] um so
[24:18.72] and one way of summarizing this i
[24:20.24] suppose is that physics in
[24:22.16] non-inertial reference frames
[24:32.72] you know as captured by the second law
[24:40.48] newton's second law not the second law
[24:42.72] of thermodynamics
[24:44.24] as captured by newton's second law gives
[24:46.88] rise
[24:51.20] to additional force like terms
[25:00.72] and uh these are called inertial forces
[25:05.60] and i'll give you some examples so we
[25:08.08] have
[25:09.68] the centrifugal force centripetal force
[25:14.40] coriolis euler
[25:19.36] et cetera et cetera depending on the
[25:21.68] non-inertial reference frame
[25:23.20] that you you have to work with you'll
[25:25.60] pick up different additional terms
[25:27.52] on the right hand side
[25:31.04] and and this is there will be a homework
[25:33.36] question on this
[25:44.08] okay we're going to distinguish forces
[25:46.88] or true forces from such
[25:48.64] apparent forces
[25:59.52] so this you know obviously these
[26:03.20] centripetal centrifugal coriolis euler
[26:05.76] and so on forces
[26:06.88] they're not true right it's just that we
[26:09.12] we decided to be
[26:10.72] a bit stubborn and describe physics with
[26:12.72] respect to an accelerating reference
[26:14.16] frame
[26:15.28] so true forces are ones
[26:18.32] that don't arise from being in a
[26:20.64] non-inertial reference frame
[26:27.36] so such apparent inertial forces
[26:31.92] so that's really crucial that we
[26:33.12] distinguish between these
[26:35.44] these two things in particular in
[26:39.20] newtonian physics
[26:44.88] this is one of those core assumptions
[26:47.04] that we're going to have to revisit when
[26:48.40] we go to the relativity
[26:49.92] and go to general relativity so in
[26:52.88] particular in newtonian physics
[26:57.12] uh gravity is a true force
[27:04.64] but this will not be true
[27:09.68] in grgr of course is general relativity
[27:14.00] the pretty much universally accepted
[27:16.16] acronym for general relativities g are
[27:18.00] they pretty much universally accepted
[27:19.52] acronym for special relativity is sr
[27:24.40] okay that's just a short
[27:27.44] reminder to set some notation of the of
[27:30.32] some concepts underlying
[27:31.84] newtonian physics and indeed these are
[27:33.44] concepts we're going to have to revisit
[27:34.64] when we
[27:35.44] uh build up general relativity now
[27:39.84] let's uh in particular these are the
[27:42.00] this is the concept of force
[27:43.36] in newtonian physics and reference
[27:44.88] frames now let's discuss
[27:46.84] mass mass is another concept that's uh
[27:50.48] fundamental in newtonian physics and
[27:52.08] also in relativity physics
[27:53.76] and also in quantum mechanics to
[27:58.56] but it turns out that although it seems
[28:01.92] intuitively clear
[28:03.68] that you know what mass is capturing
[28:05.68] there's in fact
[28:06.80] several independent notions or
[28:09.20] conceptually distinct
[28:11.12] quantities that you can call mass and
[28:13.76] this we should
[28:15.68] separate out these these different
[28:19.04] conceptually distinct quantities uh
[28:22.00] because
[28:23.52] arguing that they're the same is a is a
[28:26.24] good deal of interest it
[28:27.52] led to a good deal of interesting
[28:28.84] physics so there's at least
[28:31.92] uh i'll say at least because depending
[28:34.96] on how
[28:36.08] baroque you're feeling you might be able
[28:37.44] to think of ways to
[28:40.48] have a notion of mass that i'm captured
[28:43.04] by these lower three but i think these
[28:44.56] three will capture everything in utonium
[28:46.72] physics
[28:47.84] there's at least three conceptually
[28:53.44] distinct quantities
[28:57.44] that we could call mass i'm going to
[28:59.92] distinguish between them right
[29:02.00] so the first one is the so-called
[29:03.60] inertial mass the one familiar
[29:06.16] from the second law that i wrote down
[29:08.00] just above and i even introduced it up
[29:10.84] there
[29:13.44] and
[29:17.28] do it differently this is the constant
[29:20.48] of proportionality
[29:30.40] this is the constant proportionality
[29:31.92] newton's second law
[29:39.44] so newton's second law right in
[29:41.12] abbreviated vector form is f
[29:42.88] equals m a what's this m m is the
[29:45.60] inertial mass
[29:46.48] right of the particle it's the constant
[29:47.92] of proportionality that relates
[29:49.12] acceleration to the force
[29:54.56] but there's another notion in fact two
[29:57.92] other notions which are
[29:59.44] not often distinguished but you should
[30:02.32] distinguish them it's an exercise to
[30:03.92] prove that in fact they're the same
[30:05.52] the next notion is the notion of active
[30:08.88] gravitational mass
[30:16.16] and so this is the
[30:19.20] the mass that appears
[30:22.24] in the law that produces the
[30:23.84] gravitational field that other masses
[30:25.44] respond to
[30:53.36] so if you recall the gravitational force
[30:56.40] law
[30:57.20] g is the gravitational field produced by
[31:00.72] a mass and it has it
[31:04.16] is described by the following formula
[31:06.48] minus big g
[31:07.76] times by m little g a this is the circle
[31:11.04] active mass
[31:12.88] x minus x prime which is the
[31:15.20] displacement between
[31:16.40] the producing mass and the the test mass
[31:19.20] that
[31:20.08] responds to this field
[31:24.88] divided by x minus x prime cubed
[31:29.92] so x prime is the location
[31:36.16] of the generating mass sorry i probably
[31:38.56] said it the wrong way around let me
[31:40.88] write it correctly so x prime is the
[31:44.08] location of the generating mass
[31:46.48] and the g
[31:50.24] is the gravitational constant
[31:59.68] given by the following number 6.6743015
[32:06.64] is uncertain times 10 to the minus 11 is
[32:10.56] massively tiny meters cubed
[32:15.52] kilograms minus one seconds minus two
[32:22.64] so the fact that big g is so tiny makes
[32:26.00] understanding quantum gravity is so
[32:27.44] difficult
[32:32.40] okay so we have a notion of a of
[32:34.56] so-called active gravitational mass
[32:36.24] that's the the mass that's responsible
[32:38.08] for producing
[32:41.36] a gravitational field but there's
[32:44.00] another one right there's another notion
[32:45.60] of mass that's
[32:46.40] sort of at least our priori uh
[32:51.36] independent notion or conceptually
[32:53.04] distinct notion that's the passive
[32:54.56] gravitational mass
[33:01.28] and this is the mass that responds to an
[33:03.20] external gravitational field
[33:04.88] by accelerating
[33:08.32] so this is the notion of mass that's
[33:11.44] responsible for responding
[33:15.44] to an external
[33:19.76] gravitational field
[33:30.24] by accelerating and the formula for that
[33:33.52] is given by newton's second law m
[33:37.12] g we'll call this m subscript g
[33:40.56] but now with a p at the top times by g
[33:43.28] the gravitational field
[33:49.44] so it's the passive gravitational mass
[33:55.20] now it is assumed
[34:00.40] should note this right it's an
[34:01.60] assumption underlying a lot of physics
[34:03.44] that these masses
[34:04.56] are not negative so this is a typical
[34:07.68] assumption
[34:08.48] but not proved right you can't deduce
[34:10.80] the non-negativity of mass
[34:13.28] it's an assumption and observed
[34:15.52] supported by extensive object
[34:18.16] physics observations
[34:22.32] but it's an assumption that these are
[34:24.56] all
[34:25.44] non-negative uh interestingly
[34:29.52] it is possible to to build physics
[34:32.96] with the negative masses it's not
[34:36.08] at least immediately inconsistent there
[34:37.84] have been attempts to build physics with
[34:39.52] negative masses and things
[34:41.44] hold together it's very fascinating the
[34:44.96] physics of negative masses
[34:46.40] they're more like negative charges and
[34:48.24] all kinds of crazy things can happen
[34:49.84] when you have negative masses but it
[34:51.28] doesn't
[34:52.00] lead to immediate breakdowns of the laws
[34:54.08] of physics at least
[34:55.44] as far as what uh if you if you think
[34:58.08] about it
[34:59.44] if you try and pursue the theory there's
[35:01.84] no obvious breakdowns
[35:05.36] in physics and people have pursued this
[35:10.56] now there's a reason why we don't talk
[35:12.00] about these three masses
[35:13.68] these three concepts three distinct
[35:16.08] conceptually distinct
[35:17.44] notions of mass because there's actually
[35:19.36] relationships that you can prove and
[35:20.96] pretty much immediately
[35:27.60] between these three concepts
[35:38.80] and it's an exercise for you to show
[35:41.44] that really we don't bother with the
[35:42.72] difference between passive and active
[35:44.98] [Music]
[35:48.56] gravitational mass
[35:52.48] and the reason we don't ever bother with
[35:53.76] it is because if you use newton's third
[35:56.84] law
[36:03.76] you can actually show
[36:10.72] you can argue that mga
[36:13.76] the active gravitational mass divided by
[36:16.72] mgp
[36:17.76] the passive gravitational mass is a
[36:20.24] universal constant
[36:25.60] so if you choose your units right you
[36:27.44] can just arrange for them to be the same
[36:35.84] we conclude that mga equals mg
[36:39.68] p equals some universal gravitational
[36:42.80] mass so that's why you never really talk
[36:44.48] about
[36:44.88] the difference between these two
[36:46.64] gravitational masses
[36:48.56] you can just use newton's third law so
[36:50.16] it's a very good exercise for you to
[36:51.92] think this through
[36:52.96] do do these exercises they will also
[36:55.52] appear on the exercise sheets anyway
[36:57.68] so you're pretty much forced to do these
[36:59.28] exercises if you're taking this course
[37:02.72] now you know we we can get bold now
[37:05.44] we've seen that the active and the
[37:06.64] passive gravitational masses
[37:08.00] are the same so maybe we can just prove
[37:10.00] using newton's whatever laws that
[37:12.16] um there's a direct relationship between
[37:15.04] the
[37:15.36] inertial and gravitational mass well you
[37:18.24] can't
[37:19.04] and that's really an amazing
[37:25.20] this has led to you know this is part of
[37:27.20] the ingredients that led
[37:28.56] einstein to the general theory of
[37:29.92] relativity that the fact that you can't
[37:32.16] prove that the same but
[37:36.48] and this is crucial
[37:39.84] they appear to be equal right so
[37:42.88] this has been tested a lot there's
[37:45.20] extensive
[37:45.92] so these these quantities these concepts
[37:48.32] of gravitational inertial mass
[37:50.08] uh uh uh independent conceptual notions
[37:54.40] however extensive experimental
[37:58.72] evidence suggests right it doesn't
[38:02.88] prove it suggests that mg
[38:05.92] equals mi
[38:09.36] so the hypothesis that they're
[38:12.88] equal hasn't been rejected yet
[38:16.64] could be that they're not equal there
[38:18.00] are extensive experiments there are
[38:19.52] experiments continuing to this day that
[38:21.20] test the relationship between mg and mi
[38:23.28] but there's no
[38:24.56] so far there's no contradiction to the
[38:26.88] hypothesis
[38:28.16] that mg equals mi
[38:31.44] this leads us to the following postulate
[38:40.72] which we're going to call the
[38:41.60] universality of free fall or uff
[38:44.48] for short
[38:50.16] and the universality free pool what does
[38:51.68] it say it says that in the gravitational
[38:53.28] field g
[38:54.16] the orbit of a test mass only depends on
[38:56.16] initial conditions
[38:57.60] and given initial conditions the same
[39:00.40] then
[39:00.88] the same trajectory will be the same for
[39:02.80] all test messages our way around
[39:38.80] so the orbit in a gravitational field g
[39:41.28] the orbit of a test mass
[39:44.08] only depends on the initial conditions
[39:46.00] that's the statement of universality of
[39:47.68] free fall
[39:49.12] and if you have the same initial
[39:51.92] conditions then you can get the same
[39:53.36] trajectory for all test masses
[39:57.52] cool so initial conditions i'll
[40:01.04] abbreviate with ic
[40:05.84] so the same ics initial conditions will
[40:08.56] give
[40:09.04] the same trajectories
[40:12.88] not for just one test mass but for all
[40:15.12] test masses
[40:23.04] so let's investigate some consequences
[40:24.88] of the universality of free fall this
[40:26.56] postulate
[40:30.64] so we assume that we have a test mass
[40:33.44] which is a point
[40:34.40] right okay i haven't said this um so far
[40:38.72] but you should visualize a test mass as
[40:42.00] a point
[40:45.28] i'll just write that in quote marks
[40:46.88] because the minute you invoke quantum
[40:48.16] mechanics all this goes completely crazy
[40:51.04] and even indeed points in general
[40:52.72] relativity are pretty
[40:55.20] pretty uh
[40:58.48] let's say hairy topics you know if you
[41:01.36] concentrate a certain amount of mass
[41:03.20] into a teeny tiny radius you're going to
[41:05.44] get black holes
[41:06.56] so but it's an idealized notion the
[41:09.36] notion of a test mass as a point
[41:12.80] so you have a test mass in a
[41:14.16] gravitational field so you
[41:15.84] you can draw a gravitational field as a
[41:18.40] bunch of arrows that sort of point to
[41:19.84] something heavy
[41:20.72] like a planet this is a gravitational
[41:23.92] field g it depends on your position
[41:27.84] and so you've got a test mass in this
[41:29.44] gravitational field
[41:31.28] and so i'll draw the test mass i don't
[41:32.88] know
[41:34.40] green maybe so here's the test map
[41:38.88] make sure it's actually green when i say
[41:40.32] it's green here's the test mass it's
[41:42.08] this green dot
[41:42.88] and it's moving on some trajectory in
[41:44.80] this gravitational field generated by
[41:46.64] this
[41:47.04] heavy object according to the
[41:48.40] gravitational force law
[41:50.72] and uh well what trajectory does it
[41:52.72] follow well this one right
[41:54.88] we apply newton's second law mg times by
[41:58.16] the gravitational field where do we
[41:59.52] evaluate it where the particle is
[42:01.36] x t
[42:05.12] and it's going to be equal to the
[42:06.72] inertial mass times by
[42:08.96] the acceleration of this particle
[42:13.20] or test mass and rewriting this
[42:17.76] we see that the acceleration of the test
[42:19.68] mass is equal to the ratio
[42:21.84] of the inert of the gravitational and
[42:23.68] inertial masses
[42:29.12] times by the gravitational force field
[42:31.52] and it's this ratio
[42:32.80] which will be a universal constant
[42:35.04] according to uff
[42:53.52] so we're going to choose units from now
[42:56.84] on
[43:00.80] so that mg equals mi
[43:14.16] so i've sort of implied this already but
[43:16.96] there's an important remark
[43:24.84] uff is not a consequence of
[43:28.32] newtonian theory
[43:41.92] it's a falsifiable hypothesis
[43:53.12] and two uff relates to test masses
[44:04.48] now test masses is already sort of
[44:06.40] implied or a bit of a subtle concept
[44:08.72] because you can't have a finite mass and
[44:10.96] an infinite
[44:11.84] infinitely small volume
[44:17.04] further you know what happens
[44:20.80] when you have lots of test masses and
[44:22.72] they generate their own gravitational
[44:24.24] fields
[44:25.04] there's an element of subtlety there
[44:26.40] that we won't delve too deeply into
[44:28.40] because we will resolve this
[44:29.92] in general relativity anyway
[44:37.44] so now i've spent some time
[44:40.64] reviewing some concepts in newtonian
[44:43.44] physics
[44:44.80] the next part of the lecture today will
[44:47.20] be
[44:47.92] beginning the transition from newtonian
[44:49.92] physics to general relativity
[44:51.60] and we'll see how some of these concepts
[44:53.44] these fundamental assumptions allowing
[44:54.88] newtonian physics have to be revised
[44:57.28] and how other aspects of nutrient
[44:58.80] physics will inform the development of
[45:01.12] general relativity
[45:13.20] so this next part of the lecture will be
[45:14.64] called from newtonian gravity to general
[45:16.88] relativity
[45:20.48] and here we're going to
[45:23.52] explain
[45:28.00] how you might first attempt to
[45:29.68] incorporate relativity in newtonian
[45:31.44] physics together and gravity
[45:34.32] and i'll also expand a little bit on how
[45:37.12] gravity and special relativity are
[45:41.68] incompatible although i say that
[45:44.08] essentially with quote marks because as
[45:45.68] you'll see
[45:46.48] that the more you think about it the
[45:48.48] more you can make
[45:50.16] gravity compatible especially relativity
[45:52.08] the closer you get to general relativity
[45:57.04] so but as we're going to transition from
[45:58.96] u-turning to general relativity
[46:00.80] newtonian gravity to general relativity
[46:02.32] the first step we want to do is to
[46:03.60] formulate newtonian gravity as a field
[46:05.44] theory
[46:07.04] so this is uh this is indeed possible
[46:14.32] you probably haven't seen it formulated
[46:15.84] like this
[46:18.16] and uh it's a more or less essential
[46:21.36] ingredient if we want to express
[46:22.64] newtonian gravity as
[46:24.24] somehow a theory compatible special
[46:26.84] relativity
[46:28.72] and the motivation comes from
[46:30.08] electrodynamics right
[46:33.76] you know electrodynamics is compatible
[46:38.72] with special relativity the reason it's
[46:40.24] compatible with special relativity is
[46:41.68] that
[46:42.72] the information propagates at the speed
[46:44.56] of light and that
[46:46.32] lawrence transformations leave maxwell's
[46:48.00] equation this variant
[46:50.56] so electrodynamics and sr
[46:54.24] are compatible right that's the that's
[46:56.24] the motivation for why we're going to
[46:57.84] try and
[46:59.20] discuss newtonian theory as a field
[47:00.96] theory you can do it newtonian
[47:02.48] gravity is a field theory and since
[47:05.84] and you know why would we even think
[47:07.68] this is possible well because basically
[47:09.36] newtonian
[47:10.08] gravity looks very very much like
[47:11.76] electrostatics right
[47:16.32] so
[47:21.76] so newtonian gravity is sort of like
[47:24.16] electrostatics
[47:29.44] and when you do electrodynamics you
[47:31.60] learn how to make
[47:32.88] electrodynamics right you have your
[47:34.72] static theory this electrostatics theory
[47:36.64] you add in dynamics and then woof
[47:38.32] it's uh you get maxwell's equations and
[47:41.52] all
[47:41.84] is compatible with special relativity
[47:44.64] and we could hope
[47:45.76] by doing the same right you know we
[47:47.20] start with elect newton gravity as a
[47:49.84] static
[47:50.40] field theory we could hope that by
[47:52.72] modifying it in a similar way we might
[47:54.96] get
[47:56.08] a beautiful theory of gravity and
[47:59.20] combined with relativity
[48:02.40] so let me just before before i explain
[48:05.44] why that doesn't quite work
[48:07.92] let's highlight some similarities
[48:09.60] between
[48:14.80] newton gravity or gravito statics
[48:18.24] and electrostatics
[48:31.52] so that's our next goal let's highlight
[48:33.52] some similarities right
[48:35.36] well firstly the gravitational field
[48:42.00] is determined by an equation where do
[48:44.80] you get
[48:45.12] what is the gravitational field for a
[48:46.56] start well you give it a time
[48:48.96] and a location and it'll give you a
[48:50.48] force vector so the gravitational field
[48:52.72] is a field it takes in a time coordinate
[48:55.04] it takes in a space coordinate and it
[48:56.96] gives you a vector
[49:02.88] right time
[49:06.08] space you give it a time and a space and
[49:09.20] the gravitational field as a
[49:10.48] mathematical object hands you a vector
[49:12.40] force vector
[49:16.08] so mathematically a gravitational the
[49:18.16] gravitational field is a field right you
[49:20.00] give it a location space time and it
[49:21.36] gives you a vector so it's a vector
[49:22.64] field
[49:23.12] just like the the electric field right
[49:26.24] and so what's a source for this field
[49:29.36] well the gravitational masses right
[49:32.88] any mass
[49:38.40] so the gravitational mass density is a
[49:40.64] source for the gravitational
[49:42.40] field so mathematically the
[49:43.68] gravitational force field is a field
[49:46.16] and it's generated or is sourced by the
[49:49.52] the density of gravitational mass and
[49:52.32] the density of gravitational mass is
[49:53.84] also a field we call it rho it goes to
[49:55.76] row plus because we assume that mass is
[49:57.68] non-negative
[49:59.44] so rho give it a time and space it's
[50:02.16] mathematically a field as well it just
[50:03.68] tells you how much
[50:04.80] mass density is in that location of
[50:07.52] space time
[50:09.20] and how does mass density
[50:12.88] uh source the gravitational field well
[50:14.48] has to obey an equation well this
[50:15.84] equation right that the divergence of
[50:17.28] the gravitational
[50:18.32] field equals minus 4 pi big g
[50:21.76] times rho it's just like coulomb's law
[50:24.84] right
[50:33.92] it's just like coulomb's law so
[50:36.32] newtonian physics if you have some mass
[50:38.00] density around gravitational mass
[50:39.52] density
[50:40.48] then that generates the gravitational
[50:42.56] field how do you compute it we'll take
[50:44.08] the divergence of the gravitational
[50:46.56] field force field and set it equal to
[50:49.04] minus 4 pi g times
[50:50.40] rho then you've got yourself
[50:54.48] the gravitational field
[50:57.60] big g here
[51:01.28] uh so this is just like coulomb's law
[51:03.28] right this is looking good right
[51:05.28] when we built up electrodynamics we
[51:06.88] started out with electrostatics and then
[51:08.96] we added in dynamics and then everything
[51:10.88] worked fine
[51:12.16] now because of basic vector rules
[51:15.76] vector differential operator rules we
[51:17.60] have that
[51:19.04] if you take the curl
[51:25.12] of uh of g
[51:28.48] you get zero
[51:36.16] so g is conservative
[51:40.08] just like the electric field
[51:46.80] so what can that what does that tell us
[51:48.80] it does actually tell us something
[51:50.80] just as in electrostatics you know
[51:54.40] by poincares
[51:57.76] lemma
[52:02.08] we learn the existence of a potential
[52:06.16] phi which is also a field a scalar field
[52:11.20] so that or such that the gravitational
[52:13.76] field g can be obtained by
[52:16.16] taking the the minus the gradient of the
[52:18.40] scalar
[52:19.20] gravitational potential and these minus
[52:21.52] signs are convention
[52:23.84] you put plus sign there if you're
[52:25.12] feeling perverse
[52:27.84] but then you have to propagate it
[52:29.04] everywhere throughout your calculations
[52:38.24] so we just as in electrostatic statics
[52:48.48] we can divide a uh we can obtain a field
[52:51.92] equation
[52:52.96] for phi the gravitational potential
[53:13.36] you can derive a field equation the
[53:14.96] laplace operated times by phi
[53:18.00] is four pi g rho
[53:21.36] so the scalar potential is determined by
[53:23.60] the mass density gravitational mass
[53:25.36] density
[53:26.80] where that's porcelain equation
[53:38.96] if you want a review of electrodynamics
[53:42.96] and you happen to speak german then you
[53:44.32] can check out my two edition pcb
[53:46.16] lectures
[53:49.92] otherwise there are no shortage of very
[53:51.92] good lectures on youtube
[53:53.84] or tutorials on the basics of
[53:55.84] electrodynamics
[53:58.16] so so far gravit the newton gravity
[54:00.64] looks very much like
[54:01.84] electrostatics in fact sort of symbol
[54:04.56] for symbol
[54:05.28] you can substitute everything now we've
[54:08.64] got a
[54:11.36] a lawrence force law so there's an
[54:13.12] equation of motion for test masses
[54:17.68] which would be the analog of the
[54:19.76] lawrence law
[54:23.44] and that is that the acceleration of a
[54:25.68] test mass
[54:27.44] is minus grad phi t
[54:30.96] evaluated where the test mass actually
[54:36.84] is
[54:42.56] and that's also a very interesting
[54:48.24] analog of electrostatics
[54:52.32] or i should say that i've assumed here
[54:56.40] so for the mathematically
[54:59.76] minded there is some assumptions
[55:03.52] underlying
[55:05.68] the the solution to possible equation
[55:09.28] um that i'm about to to show i'm going
[55:12.48] to assume here
[55:13.60] that the support of the gravitational
[55:16.32] mass
[55:17.60] density field is compact what does that
[55:20.96] mean it means that there's not a
[55:22.24] continuous distribution of matter
[55:23.60] throughout the universe in fact
[55:25.04] the distribution of matter is stuck in
[55:27.12] finite regions
[55:29.20] so if you know some topology which is
[55:32.64] not strictly necessary for this
[55:34.00] course what i'm assuming here is that
[55:37.60] the closure of the set
[55:39.20] of points where the gravitational mass
[55:40.72] density is not zero
[55:43.20] that that set is compact
[55:47.68] and since we're in uh
[55:56.40] in euclidean space then we can invoke
[55:58.56] the heiner boggle theorem and we learned
[56:00.24] that that's
[56:01.20] a closed and bounded region so if the
[56:04.24] mass density
[56:05.04] gravitational mass density we're going
[56:06.64] to assume
[56:08.88] that the gravitational mass densities is
[56:11.44] restricted to finite regions
[56:16.40] we've got this this possible equation
[56:18.72] for the gravitational
[56:20.64] scalar potential
[56:23.68] uh can we deduce the gravitational
[56:25.52] scalar potential as a function of rho
[56:27.20] well yes we can we've done that in
[56:28.88] electrode statics
[56:32.00] and as long as you're a bit careful
[56:33.20] about your boundary conditions
[56:38.64] to prevent weird soliton solutions
[56:43.44] so as long as the gravitational scalar
[56:45.44] potential is assumed to decay to zero
[56:47.84] as you go out to infinity
[56:51.68] then we get a unique solution for the
[56:54.72] gravitational scalar potential just as
[56:56.56] we do in electrostatics
[56:58.08] it's minus g the integral over all of
[57:00.48] space
[57:03.04] so three dimensional integral you take
[57:05.44] the gravitational
[57:06.56] you take the gravitational mass density
[57:09.44] divided by x minus x
[57:10.96] prime take the norm and integrate that
[57:14.56] over all of space and uh
[57:18.40] and then you have a nice well-defined
[57:19.92] gravitational scale of potential
[57:24.72] and so
[57:27.76] we have a beautiful analog
[57:33.04] of electrostatics that we might call
[57:36.32] grabato statics
[57:46.88] and seeing this you'll be like this is
[57:49.92] great
[57:51.60] well let's just do what we did for
[57:52.84] electrodynamics and we've combined
[57:56.48] relativity and gravitational newtonian
[57:58.32] gravity theory
[57:59.52] so let's just
[58:02.80] talk a little bit about what happens if
[58:04.72] you try and do that so how to add
[58:06.84] dynamics
[58:08.96] to the gravitational field
[58:12.64] so at the moment the gravitational field
[58:14.48] in this discussion is static it doesn't
[58:16.24] change with time
[58:23.36] so we have you know some options for how
[58:25.60] to add dynamics
[58:26.64] to the gravitational field so what
[58:28.32] happens if the the mass density that
[58:30.40] sources the gravitational field what
[58:31.60] happens if that changes well we could
[58:33.52] just assume instantaneous propagation
[58:44.08] or we could add dynamics to the
[58:45.36] gravitational field by
[58:47.20] assuming a scalar wave equation for five
[58:53.52] just that's not what happened in
[58:56.16] electrodynamics but hey right we could
[58:57.60] do it here
[59:01.84] it's allowed we could do the
[59:03.76] electrodynamics thing
[59:05.36] we could complete the gravitational
[59:09.20] scalar
[59:10.32] potential to a vector to a four vector
[59:16.00] it's a third option and just like for
[59:20.12] electrodynamics
[59:27.36] or we could complete
[59:33.36] phi to a tensor
[59:36.96] in this case a symmetric 10. so this
[59:38.48] will make more sense as we go through
[59:40.00] the course
[59:42.40] that'll be a fourth options fifth five
[59:44.24] fifths and six options but
[59:45.68] interestingly some things happen when
[59:48.48] you follow up these assumptions
[59:50.16] now there's a very beautiful discussion
[59:51.84] of this in mexico and wheeler chapter
[59:53.44] seven i highly recommend you go and take
[59:54.88] a look at it
[59:57.84] where they follow up all of these
[59:59.04] options for adding dynamics to the
[60:01.12] gravitational field so
[60:03.92] i don't really need to say much about
[60:05.20] the zeroth version there's obvious
[60:07.20] causality problems that make it
[60:08.80] incompatible
[60:10.24] with special relativity
[60:15.68] you know you can see by moving masses
[60:17.60] around you can signal faster than the
[60:19.20] speed of light
[60:20.32] so you know zero is out right you can't
[60:22.40] do that
[60:24.48] now one you can do but
[60:27.84] it's ruled out by observations because
[60:29.92] it there's no bending of light
[60:32.24] which has been observed
[60:35.76] two you can do uh as well
[60:38.80] but there's problems with the perihelion
[60:41.28] procession
[60:51.84] so that's ruled out by experiments as
[60:53.44] well and also you get negative energy
[60:56.32] waves
[61:02.64] it's pretty bad so we're left with three
[61:06.24] or are we left with three maybe there's
[61:07.52] more options so three
[61:09.76] if you follow up completing the scalar
[61:12.64] gravitational potential to a
[61:14.08] full tensor the rank two tensor
[61:17.52] then you actually uh
[61:20.56] discover something pretty amazing
[61:25.52] this route leads to the linearized
[61:28.80] einstein equation
[61:44.16] and sort of implicitly and indirectly
[61:47.04] you go to gr
[61:49.52] so really by taking newton's
[61:53.20] theory of gravity and trying to make it
[61:55.36] compatible with special relativity and
[61:57.04] the observations
[61:58.96] and available experimental observations
[62:01.12] you are forced
[62:02.00] to think of completing the gravitational
[62:04.48] scale potential to a tensor
[62:06.32] when you go down that root you discover
[62:07.92] that the dynamics you give to the
[62:09.20] gravitational field
[62:10.24] are governed by linearized form of
[62:11.52] einstein's field equations and then by
[62:13.68] somewhat indirect but you know logically
[62:16.96] uh logically okay argument you can then
[62:20.08] get
[62:20.64] um general relativity or deduce general
[62:22.56] relativity
[62:24.08] we are not going to do that this way and
[62:26.32] einstein certainly did not follow this
[62:28.08] route or at least
[62:29.04] we don't know from the historical record
[62:31.20] whether einstein followed this route
[62:34.16] instead we're going to discover general
[62:35.60] relativity in a completely different
[62:37.28] other way
[62:38.88] that's it for lecture one thank you for
[62:42.32] joining me on this journey and i look
[62:44.00] forward to seeing you in the next
