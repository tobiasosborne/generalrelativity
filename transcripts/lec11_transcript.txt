[00:00.00] hello and welcome back to introduction
[00:01.68] to general relativity
[00:03.12] in the previous lecture i introduced the
[00:06.00] riemann curvature tensor
[00:07.76] and the goal today is to continue our
[00:09.68] discussion of the riemann curvature
[00:11.12] tensor investigate some of its
[00:12.56] properties and relate it
[00:14.16] in a fundamental way to the divergence
[00:16.56] of nearby geodesics on a curved manifold
[00:23.92] before we do
[00:26.96] obtain our advertised
[00:31.12] connection between the curvature tensor
[00:33.12] and the
[00:34.40] displacement of nearby geodesics we need
[00:36.24] to understand
[00:37.84] how to relate the action of
[00:42.16] the curvature tensor on vector fields
[00:44.56] and other
[00:45.60] tensorial objects
[00:50.88] and we're going to do this in that we
[00:54.64] study the action of the commutator
[01:00.24] so i may occasionally write this
[01:02.08] expression as the commutator
[01:05.36] of the derivative operator
[01:08.72] so you're going to need to understand
[01:11.28] the action of this
[01:12.00] commutator on vector fields when we
[01:13.52] understand that we'll be able to relate
[01:15.20] it
[01:15.52] to the riemann curvature so we'll see
[01:17.20] how the riemann curvature tensor
[01:19.68] acts on vector fields
[01:35.68] so the way we obtain this action is we
[01:38.32] consider the commutator of these two
[01:39.92] derivative operators and we
[01:41.28] we use the same argumentation that we
[01:43.52] used to understand the action of the
[01:45.44] derivative operator on
[01:46.96] uh arbitrary vector intensive fields
[01:50.16] namely we uh suppose that t a
[01:54.72] and omega a are
[01:59.28] arbitrary
[02:02.80] vector and dual
[02:09.20] vector fields
[02:13.44] then we form the scalar which is just
[02:16.24] the contraction
[02:19.44] and then we act on it with this
[02:20.96] derivative operator and we apply the
[02:22.64] leibniz rule
[02:23.60] and
[02:26.72] sooner or later when the dust settles of
[02:28.72] this calculation
[02:30.24] we'll understand how
[02:33.52] to apply this commutator of derivative
[02:35.92] operators on a vector field
[02:37.76] so step one we got this expression we're
[02:40.00] going to apply
[02:40.80] the leibniz property to evaluate
[02:45.92] the action of the first derivative
[02:47.44] operator on the scalar that we form
[02:49.44] between t
[02:50.16] and omega
[02:55.20] and we obtained the following expression
[02:57.60] so you just imagine
[02:58.56] i'm now working the delta a operator
[03:01.52] through the scalar contraction
[03:06.72] and then we are able to factorize
[03:10.16] out the
[03:14.48] and then we were able to apply the
[03:17.52] second derivative operator to this
[03:19.44] expression and
[03:21.60] what we find is
[03:24.96] applying the leibniz property and
[03:26.64] canceling out
[03:28.72] common terms some effectively going to
[03:32.40] skip
[03:33.44] one line of derivation here we find that
[03:36.48] the action of these delta a delta b
[03:40.16] minus delta b delta a
[03:46.88] simplifies to this rather nice
[03:48.24] expression here
[03:55.68] and so i've
[03:58.96] skipped an intermediate step and we note
[04:02.16] that we we know what to do with one part
[04:04.08] of this expression so that's
[04:05.60] we already know how this community acts
[04:07.36] on dual vector fields so we can
[04:08.88] substitute now
[04:16.56] the action of this on dual vector fields
[04:20.08] and that's namely
[04:20.96] by the riemann curvature tensor
[04:24.56] abc d that's the action in yellow on
[04:28.96] dual vector fields and we we have that
[04:32.56] zero equals this expression so
[04:34.32] the only conclusion we can draw since
[04:35.76] this has to be true for all vector
[04:37.12] fields in all dual vector fields
[04:39.68] we learn that this the action of these
[04:43.36] two vector fields
[04:45.44] of these two derivative operators on
[04:46.96] vector fields is
[04:49.60] none other than as
[04:52.64] a contraction of the riemann curvature
[04:54.84] tensor
[04:56.08] of the third slot of this riemann
[04:57.68] curvature tensor against
[04:59.84] the vector field t
[05:03.92] similarly and this is really for you
[05:13.52] we find for an arbitrary tensor field
[05:22.16] that the commutator of these derivative
[05:25.60] operators
[05:27.92] acts as follows
[05:34.32] so basically you sum over every slot or
[05:36.48] argument of
[05:37.76] the tensor and then if it's a dual
[05:40.08] vector type
[05:41.12] argument or slot or leg of
[05:44.24] the tensor then
[05:48.08] you use
[05:51.44] the action
[05:55.12] that we already know for the riemann
[05:57.20] curvature tense on dual vector fields
[05:59.20] and if it's a vector type leg entry
[06:02.40] slot we use
[06:07.68] the action we've just obtained
[06:10.80] for vector fields
[06:17.12] and so we have a completely general
[06:19.52] expression
[06:20.80] for the action of the commutator of two
[06:23.60] derivative operators on an arbitrary
[06:25.52] density field
[06:38.48] so you can see the riemann curvature
[06:40.32] tends to plays a rather important role
[06:42.16] in the action or understanding curvature
[06:45.52] of manifolds so it
[06:49.20] it's therefore worthwhile recognizing
[06:52.56] the
[06:53.04] the central role played by this tensor
[06:56.16] it's worthwhile understanding a few of
[06:57.84] its properties or obtaining some of its
[07:00.84] properties
[07:06.48] and that's our goal now
[07:09.84] so the next part of today's
[07:13.36] discussion will be focused on
[07:14.96] establishing the following
[07:17.12] four fundamental properties of the
[07:19.68] riemann curvature tensor
[07:22.16] and these will come in handy in various
[07:24.00] ways in the coming
[07:25.20] lectures giving us neat ways to do
[07:29.04] computations it will give us
[07:33.04] ways to prove results without doing
[07:34.88] computations and
[07:37.28] everything in between so it's
[07:46.00] it's pretty important that we understand
[07:51.44] these basic properties so the first
[07:53.28] property is that the riemann curvature
[07:54.80] tensor is
[07:55.68] anti-symmetric under exchange of the
[07:57.52] first two arguments
[07:59.68] entries slots legs the second is that
[08:02.88] when you anti-symmetrize over the first
[08:04.56] three arguments you get zero
[08:05.84] the third one pertains
[08:10.00] to the metric and derivative and when
[08:12.24] you lower one of the indices
[08:17.28] of the riemann curvature tensor and the
[08:20.24] fourth one
[08:23.28] which will turn out to play a key role
[08:24.88] in determining and defining the einstein
[08:27.36] curvature tensor
[08:34.72] is an identity involving the action of a
[08:36.88] derivative operator on the curvature
[08:38.48] tensor itself
[08:41.28] so here's four properties they will all
[08:44.64] turn out to be useful in various forms
[08:46.56] in
[08:46.96] the rest of our course so we'll spend a
[08:49.20] little bit of time
[08:50.00] now proving them
[08:54.40] let's take a look at one okay
[08:59.36] that one's easy just look at the
[09:01.60] definition of the curvature tensor
[09:04.08] and compare it with the
[09:07.76] definition where b is replaced with a
[09:11.92] so we could we've already established
[09:13.20] one so now let's get on to two
[09:17.76] so for an arbitrary
[09:21.68] dual vector field omega a and
[09:24.80] any derivative operator
[09:28.96] right doesn't even have to be the one
[09:32.16] determined by the metric
[09:33.68] we have the following result is true
[09:39.04] that if you anti-symmetrize over the
[09:41.20] application
[09:42.40] of the derivative operator twice to the
[09:45.04] dual vector field you get zero
[09:50.88] um so
[09:55.12] how does that follow well we'll check
[09:57.20] this as follows
[10:06.48] so we'll look at the left hand side
[10:11.92] and we'll
[10:14.96] substitute for the definition of the
[10:17.92] derivative operator
[10:19.20] in terms of a coordinate chart
[10:27.12] so the left hand side equals
[10:30.40] this expression here here we're just
[10:32.00] substituting now
[10:37.36] for the action of the covariance
[10:39.84] derivative
[10:41.12] delta b in terms of the coordinate chart
[10:44.84] derivative
[10:46.88] and then we'll do it again right so
[10:48.96] we've got delta a acting but we know how
[10:50.56] that acts
[10:51.12] so this is the same as
[10:57.68] the following action
[11:05.84] and i'm employing for the first time
[11:07.36] here in notation that i'll explain
[11:08.88] in a second
[11:18.00] so there's lots of terms now
[11:38.88] here comes the final term
[11:50.88] okay so i need to explain this notation
[11:52.96] so this notation
[11:54.32] it has to do with anti-symmetrization so
[11:56.16] it appears here i've got this
[11:58.88] notation where the square bracket a b
[12:01.04] then this vertical line d
[12:02.56] vertical line and then c that means
[12:05.76] anti-symmetrize over a b and c but
[12:07.92] ignore d
[12:26.24] so that's what that notation means when
[12:27.84] you put these vertical lines around
[12:30.40] one of these abstract index notation
[12:33.28] index
[12:33.84] indices then it means ignore it when you
[12:36.16] do the anti-symmetrization
[12:39.28] okay so we've got a big long massive of
[12:42.00] expressions
[12:43.92] uh we've got in particular we've got six
[12:45.76] terms to to
[12:47.04] focus on we have to worry about and
[12:49.60] let's just check each one well the first
[12:51.28] one
[12:52.16] vanishes because d a d b
[12:55.52] is the same as d b d a but we're
[12:57.52] anti-symmetrizing so that one's going to
[12:58.96] go to zero
[13:01.12] the second term vanishes because c is
[13:03.76] symmetric in the first two index indices
[13:06.24] the third term vanishes because c is
[13:07.84] symmetric in the first two
[13:10.56] indices the third term vanishes because
[13:13.68] c
[13:14.00] is and is symmetric in b and c as does
[13:17.20] the fourth term
[13:18.32] and the final term also vanishes
[13:29.36] because that's just re-labeling
[13:36.72] if you write out the final term here
[13:39.92] you may need to spend a couple of
[13:41.20] minutes to think about why that's also
[13:43.12] vanishing
[13:44.88] and that's got to do with the fact that
[13:46.00] we have to relabel indices
[13:50.80] so if you write out all six terms
[13:52.48] appearing in that anti-symmetrization
[13:54.00] you'll be able to pair them up
[13:55.52] the positive and negative ones and you
[13:56.88] get zero so in fact you get zero
[13:59.20] for this whole expression and so
[14:02.32] thus right what have we learned well
[14:04.72] we've learned that zero
[14:07.12] equals two times the anti-symmetrization
[14:11.28] of delta a delta
[14:12.64] delta b omega c
[14:16.56] okay i'm just taking twice what i had
[14:18.48] above
[14:19.68] but uh we can write that out in a
[14:22.32] different way
[14:30.88] namely that's equal to this expression
[14:32.56] here just by index substitution
[14:39.92] but that's also you can understand that
[14:42.00] as being the same as the
[14:44.00] anti-symmetrized version of the
[14:45.52] riemann curvature tensor applied to
[14:47.04] omega d so we now know
[14:49.04] that the anti-symmetrize the rhema
[14:51.04] curvature tensor anti-symmetries over
[14:52.72] the first three indices
[14:53.76] is zero okay let's prove
[14:57.20] three
[15:01.84] this one comes a bit easier than the
[15:03.76] previous one
[15:06.80] so consider
[15:08.02] [Music]
[15:09.84] the action
[15:12.88] of covering derivatives on the metric
[15:17.20] well i've just said that the action of
[15:19.44] the covariance derivative of the metric
[15:20.72] is zero
[15:21.20] right that's the defining characteristic
[15:23.52] of our
[15:24.56] derivative operator here so that's
[15:28.08] zero but of course there's another a way
[15:30.80] to determine the action of the
[15:32.08] commutator of two derivative operators
[15:33.68] on a tensor namely we have that
[15:35.28] tensor formula here here in yellow
[15:38.88] called star maybe by star
[15:41.92] there's another way to compute this this
[15:43.84] thing
[15:45.04] and the way you do it is well you
[15:46.72] contract the curvature tensor against
[15:48.56] every entry of your tensor in this case
[15:51.92] g
[15:52.32] so we'll do it twice
[15:58.00] but that's just the same as pulling down
[16:00.88] these indices
[16:04.96] and then we're done right so we've
[16:06.56] proved three
[16:09.68] and the fourth all that's left now over
[16:11.92] is the the fourth
[16:13.28] uh condition the bianchi identity
[16:19.92] this one is a little bit trickier maybe
[16:22.24] so we're going to consider the action of
[16:24.00] our derivative operator or the
[16:25.44] commutator of our derivative operators
[16:27.20] on
[16:27.92] the derivative operator applied to some
[16:30.16] arbitrary joule
[16:31.92] a dual vector field omega d
[16:35.60] well this thing that's easy enough to to
[16:39.44] do
[16:39.76] right because this thing here i've
[16:41.36] highlighted that's a tensor of type
[16:43.68] zero two so we just apply the tensor
[16:46.32] rule
[16:46.96] for the action of the riemann curvature
[16:49.36] tensor
[16:50.16] so we can compute that expression this
[17:02.84] way
[17:08.56] and we get this expression
[17:14.88] but consider that but also
[17:18.56] we're gonna at the same time consider
[17:20.24] another expression involving three
[17:22.00] derivative operators
[17:30.84] so
[17:37.84] and that's well pretty easy right that's
[17:40.24] just the action of the riemann curvature
[17:41.76] tensor on the dual vector field omega d
[17:43.76] then differentiated
[17:49.84] and then we do the leibniz property to
[17:51.44] get the action of that derivative
[17:53.04] operator through
[18:03.44] and now
[18:06.56] suppose we call the first expression i
[18:08.48] in the second expression i
[18:09.84] i if we anti-symmetrize
[18:16.00] i and i i
[18:19.52] over a b and c
[18:20.77] [Music]
[18:24.00] both sides both expressions become equal
[18:40.40] so we can equate both the
[18:42.72] anti-symmetrized version of i and the
[18:44.16] anti-symmetric version of ii
[18:53.12] and we can use other properties that
[18:55.28] we've already determined
[18:58.80] remember my vertical line notation here
[19:01.52] means
[19:02.00] don't anti-symmetrize over that slot
[19:06.32] argument index
[19:29.92] so some of these terms cancel this term
[19:32.16] cancels by property
[19:33.76] two i think we call it
[19:37.20] yep property two
[19:40.64] and we're going to bring this term over
[19:49.12] and we see that they're actually equal
[19:50.72] those two terms
[19:53.20] so
[19:59.68] for all omega e
[20:03.04] we have that omega e delta of a
[20:07.12] rbc d e is zero
[20:12.08] and hence we've derived the b and key
[20:18.84] identity
[20:24.64] and we're done this proof
[20:29.44] now the riemann curvature tensor is an
[20:32.24] intrinsic invariant that captures
[20:34.64] the curvature of a manifold so you've
[20:37.52] got to think of the riemann curvature
[20:38.96] tensor
[20:41.76] as a kind of machine box
[20:46.84] device it has
[20:49.68] um four and four arguments
[20:55.28] it takes a vector here it takes a vector
[20:58.88] here
[21:00.48] it takes a vector here
[21:04.88] and it has a dual vector argument but we
[21:08.72] use that dual vector in a different way
[21:10.80] so you can think of the riemann
[21:13.36] curvature tensor as a box that eats
[21:15.12] three vectors and produces
[21:16.96] one vector if you like one joule vector
[21:21.68] that's not the way we're going to think
[21:23.20] about the riemann curvature tensor
[21:25.68] we're going to think of the riemann
[21:26.64] curvature tensor as a linear
[21:29.04] transformation on
[21:30.00] tangent vector spaces so
[21:42.84] times
[21:51.36] so you've got to think about these these
[21:53.20] arguments
[21:56.64] in the following way so the second
[21:58.16] argument the first argument of the
[21:59.20] riemann curvature tends to think of that
[22:00.72] as
[22:01.04] being defining a coordinate axis of a
[22:03.92] two-dimensional subspace of
[22:05.44] m
[22:09.52] and you've got to think of the second
[22:10.88] vector
[22:14.00] argument of the riemann curvature tensor
[22:16.08] is defining a second coordinate axis
[22:19.92] and then if you stick those two
[22:21.52] arguments in what you're left with
[22:25.68] so if we if we you know give the riemann
[22:28.24] curvature tense of these two arguments
[22:31.60] let's call them v and w
[22:34.80] then we're left with a device which
[22:39.68] can be thought of as a matrix right
[22:47.76] it's got in abstract index notation it
[22:50.56] looks like this right it's got one upper
[22:52.24] index and one lower index
[22:54.00] and this is a you know a matrix right
[22:56.48] that's one way of
[22:57.44] thinking it or linear
[23:06.84] transformation
[23:08.56] of the tangent space so what you've got
[23:11.76] to think of
[23:13.20] is this device
[23:16.72] eats two vectors so you hand it two
[23:18.72] vectors these two vectors define
[23:22.40] you've got to think of those two vectors
[23:23.60] as defining a two dimensional surface
[23:25.68] inside
[23:26.32] m and that's these two vectors define
[23:29.44] the where the loop is that you're going
[23:30.88] to do this parallel transport around
[23:33.28] and then once you've chosen these two
[23:34.96] vectors being w to define the surface
[23:37.12] inside
[23:37.60] m the riemann curvature tensor
[23:40.72] tells you how a vector initially at the
[23:42.80] point p gets parallel transported around
[23:44.64] that loop
[23:45.20] so it gives you the second order
[23:46.40] correction right that's what we saw in
[23:47.92] the previous lecture
[23:49.20] it's the way to think of the riemann
[23:50.40] curvature tensor now it turns out
[23:52.96] of course there are lots of
[23:53.92] circumstances where it's you know you
[23:56.08] don't want to
[23:57.12] you don't need all that information so
[23:58.80] this is this is by the way you know
[24:00.56] all the information that you can require
[24:03.20] to specify the parallel transport of a
[24:05.12] little vector around a loop
[24:06.48] you know an arbitrary loop now you think
[24:08.80] of what you need to specify an arbitrary
[24:10.24] loop in a manifold where you need two
[24:11.76] two vectors to give this coordinate
[24:13.20] plane and you need
[24:14.88] uh and and then the parallel transport
[24:17.20] to second order is then captured
[24:18.64] completely by the riemann curvature turn
[24:20.08] so there's no more information to
[24:21.36] capture so this is
[24:22.48] like all the second order structure of
[24:24.56] your manifold is captured by the riemann
[24:26.24] curvature tensor
[24:27.28] but often in applications you don't need
[24:28.96] all of that information like
[24:30.40] you're going to sum over various indices
[24:32.24] because you average or whatever
[24:35.68] and so it turns out that a couple of
[24:37.44] derived tensor fields play a special
[24:39.36] role in general relativity
[24:43.36] and the first derived tensor so
[24:46.80] this has less strictly less or usually
[24:49.36] less information than the riemann
[24:50.64] curvature tensor
[24:52.08] depends on your dimension so the first
[24:54.00] derived tensor that we're going to
[24:55.52] define is the circle richie tensor
[24:57.84] and that's what you get when you
[24:59.12] contract over the second argument of the
[25:01.76] riemann curvature tensor and the fourth
[25:07.60] this plays a pretty important role in
[25:09.84] general relativity
[25:19.04] and uh well note
[25:22.24] this riemann this richie turtle has a
[25:24.64] nice symmetry property
[25:29.92] and that followed by three
[25:33.36] by property three of the riemann
[25:34.72] curvature tensor
[25:36.40] and we also define
[25:39.84] something called the scalar curvature
[25:46.56] which is the contraction of the richie
[25:54.84] tensor
[26:07.44] and turns out there's one final tensor
[26:09.52] that will play
[26:10.48] probably the most important role in
[26:13.12] general relativity
[26:14.96] and that to define that tensor we're
[26:16.80] going to note
[26:18.24] we're going to first make an observation
[26:20.16] and then use the result of that
[26:21.28] observation
[26:22.24] to actually introduce our definition
[26:26.72] so to get this third tensor that we
[26:31.68] that will play the important role in
[26:32.96] general relativity we're going to put
[26:34.16] contracted by
[26:35.04] bianchi identity
[26:38.24] and what do we get when we do that well
[26:42.32] b c d a plus this is i'm just writing
[26:45.92] out the bianchi identity
[26:47.84] and we've contracted it over
[26:53.44] uh
[26:59.04] what have we contracted it against a and
[27:01.36] b
[27:04.56] so then
[27:08.00] take that expression and contract it
[27:09.84] with
[27:11.44] gbd
[27:15.60] right and that effectively raises d and
[27:18.48] then contracts it with with b
[27:22.56] and so when you do that you get this
[27:25.36] expression here
[27:28.64] and now we've got an expression where
[27:29.92] the riemann curvature tensor has
[27:32.84] vanished
[27:39.84] and we have just by a bit of index
[27:46.84] shuffling
[27:49.04] we have obtained
[27:53.60] a very simple expression for the
[27:55.84] divergence of a certain tensor field
[27:58.16] and we
[28:02.80] oh you know that should be just all
[28:04.48] right um so what we've learned
[28:12.56] is that if you take the divergence the
[28:16.88] so-called
[28:20.00] which is just contracting the the raised
[28:26.32] this is the definition of the divergence
[28:34.88] by applying or contracting again the
[28:36.96] tensor against the raised derivative
[28:38.48] operator then we get that that
[28:40.00] divergence of this new tensor that's
[28:42.80] appeared here gab is zero
[28:44.96] where what is this new tensor
[28:48.24] well it's defined by the line above
[28:55.52] and there's divergencelessness of this
[28:58.48] final
[28:59.12] tensor here turns out to play be very
[29:02.56] play a crucial role in formulating
[29:04.00] einstein's field equations
[29:05.60] and this this tensor here has a has a
[29:08.24] name
[29:10.08] and it's the einstein tensor
[29:18.32] okay so for the rest of
[29:22.24] those are three three derived tensor
[29:25.28] fields that we get
[29:26.00] from the the riemann curvature tensor so
[29:29.12] far we've
[29:29.68] we've just studied the riemann curvature
[29:31.20] sensor established some of its basic
[29:33.04] uh contraction properties and
[29:35.76] differential properties
[29:37.60] we've defined these three
[29:40.80] derived tensor fields and now we're
[29:43.20] going to relate
[29:44.24] the riemann curvature tensor to yet
[29:45.84] another interpretation
[29:48.08] and this one will be the the one that
[29:50.16] plays the most important role in
[29:51.84] deriving the einstein's field equations
[29:54.08] so so far we understand the remain
[29:55.92] curvature tensor as this just either age
[29:58.24] is this
[29:59.28] this mathematical object the commutator
[30:01.12] of two derivative operators or
[30:02.88] b we understand it as telling us about
[30:05.68] the parallel transport of a vector
[30:06.96] around the little tiny loop to second
[30:08.48] order
[30:09.36] but there's a third interpretation of
[30:12.24] the curvature tensor
[30:13.84] that plays the most important role and
[30:15.92] it's this it's called the geodesic
[30:17.60] deviation equation
[30:22.88] and what this tells us is that the human
[30:25.28] curvature tensor is related to the
[30:26.80] acceleration of nearby geodesics away
[30:29.20] from each other
[31:05.20] so you imagine that you have two
[31:08.00] geodesics that are initially
[31:09.60] nearby the infinitesimally close and
[31:12.32] then you let them
[31:13.68] move apart move on your manifold and so
[31:15.84] when you have two geodesics nearby on a
[31:17.84] manifold
[31:18.64] if there's no curvature if the manifold
[31:20.64] is not curved and those geodesics will
[31:22.40] always stay nearby
[31:23.44] right if they're pointing in the same
[31:24.64] direction
[31:27.44] now if you have curvature like you're on
[31:30.72] the surface of the sphere then those
[31:32.08] geodesics can diverge or they can
[31:34.08] converge later on and this this
[31:37.92] relative acceleration can actually be
[31:39.84] captured completely by the riemann
[31:41.52] curvature tensor
[31:42.72] so to make this precise we have to spend
[31:45.04] a little bit of time
[31:46.16] defining what we could mean by too
[31:48.48] nearby geodesics
[31:50.48] so that needs a little bit of work
[32:00.88] so we want to we want to talk about
[32:03.12] smooth one parameter families of
[32:04.88] geodesics
[32:09.60] you know that doesn't mean one geodesic
[32:11.04] that means you've got a whole bunch of
[32:12.16] them
[32:13.60] and they're all sort of nearby each
[32:15.20] other
[32:18.32] and it's perfectly easy to imagine a
[32:21.28] chaotic situation where you've got one
[32:22.80] geodesic pointing one way and then
[32:24.40] infinitely it says something close by
[32:26.00] you're going to do it does it put in
[32:26.96] another way no no no we don't want to
[32:28.72] discuss such crazy situations let's
[32:31.04] let's consider a nice situation
[32:34.80] so what can we mean by a nice family of
[32:36.96] geodesics well
[32:38.40] what we mean is that gamma s is a
[32:40.84] geodesic
[32:44.32] firstly for all s
[32:47.76] in some interval in r
[32:52.48] i don't know minus epsilon epsilon
[32:56.96] uh and that's not enough
[33:00.88] you know we don't want th that could i
[33:03.28] could easily construct such a gamma s
[33:04.88] with a completely crazy
[33:06.56] spray of geodesics going everywhere we
[33:08.80] also want that they depend smoothly as
[33:10.56] you vary s
[33:11.52] and as you vary the the curve parameter
[33:13.52] or geodesic parameter
[33:15.12] and what the smooth mean in this context
[33:16.88] it means
[33:21.04] that it as you take a pair of the pair
[33:23.60] of parameters snt to a geodesic
[33:26.32] that you get a smooth
[33:29.68] uh one to one no no
[33:33.44] these geodesics aren't crossing each
[33:36.84] other
[33:38.32] one-to-one map
[33:45.28] and furthermore it's invertible
[33:48.96] and the inverse
[33:52.16] is smooth yeah that's about we're trying
[33:55.28] to demand that our family of geodesics
[33:57.04] forms a nice smooth
[33:58.56] family like a surface
[34:05.28] and then let's just say it so let sigma
[34:07.52] be the 2d manifold
[34:10.00] sub manifold
[34:28.32] so you can think of gamma st as defining
[34:30.16] a smooth sub manifold
[34:32.48] and st are the coordinate
[34:35.92] re coordinate system right for this
[34:46.84] manifold
[34:54.72] and i'll draw a picture now see this is
[34:57.12] the
[34:58.56] picture you should have in mind when i'm
[35:00.40] talking about a smooth family of
[35:02.08] geodesics here this sort of
[35:04.32] here's drawn a whole bunch of geodesics
[35:09.04] and we're going to have two two
[35:11.76] parameters
[35:13.68] s and t so
[35:17.92] t s labels our
[35:22.48] which geodesic we have
[35:25.84] and t labels where we are along the
[35:28.84] geodesic
[35:31.76] and corresponding to these two
[35:33.20] coordinates there are two
[35:35.04] tangent vectors
[35:38.48] it's called the tangent vector in the
[35:40.56] direction of the curve capital t
[35:42.08] a and the other one capital x a
[35:54.48] so t a what is that it's defined to be
[35:57.84] this tangent vector here
[35:59.28] as you infinitesimally change little d
[36:13.84] and because it's a tangent
[36:17.52] of a geodesic
[36:24.96] we have of course that t
[36:28.32] a delta a t b is zero right the geodesic
[36:32.24] is a curve for which its tangent vector
[36:33.92] is parallel transported along itself
[36:40.32] now we have another vector field
[36:48.88] the vector field capital x a which is
[36:52.32] defined by dds a you can interpret that
[36:56.08] as the displacement
[37:01.28] to a nearby
[37:04.88] vector field nearby geodesic
[37:22.32] right you think of
[37:26.00] just infinitesimally varying s and
[37:30.24] at the point gamma as t xa points in the
[37:33.44] direction of the nearby geodesic
[37:40.48] now now we want to spend a bit of a time
[37:42.24] rescaling our parameters so they're just
[37:44.16] right
[37:44.56] for the calculation we're about to do
[37:48.00] so we're going to rescale our t
[37:50.24] parameter
[37:52.96] with an s dependent
[37:57.20] factor
[38:00.40] remember that the geodesic parameter t
[38:04.32] may be rescaled and that doesn't change
[38:06.56] the fact that it's a geodesic
[38:08.40] but
[38:11.84] we can ensure that various properties
[38:13.76] are satisfied
[38:25.04] and the first property we want to
[38:28.88] require is that the length of the
[38:30.48] tangent vector doesn't vary as you
[38:32.64] change the s parameter which geodesic
[38:34.64] you're on
[38:37.92] now remember s and t are coordinates
[38:41.36] so they're corresponding tangent vectors
[38:47.44] commute in the sense of vector fields
[39:05.36] so it's another property that will come
[39:08.88] out
[39:09.44] in handy when we start
[39:12.64] trying to relate the situation to
[39:14.16] curvature
[39:15.92] so that also has the consequence that x
[39:19.12] a t
[39:19.60] a is constant
[39:29.28] you can add a constant to the s
[39:30.80] parameter in the t parameter
[39:37.36] not only can you overall scale the
[39:40.84] parameters
[39:52.24] and by the addition of this constant
[39:57.52] well it's an s dependent constant
[40:04.16] we can ensure that in fact the inner
[40:06.16] product between x and t
[40:08.32] is zero so they're orthonormal or
[40:10.72] orthogonal
[40:13.12] because x a need not have uh unit norm
[40:21.84] now let's interpret these things
[40:31.84] so first quantity we want to interpret
[40:33.52] is the quantity va
[40:34.88] defined by the covariance derivative in
[40:37.28] the direction of t
[40:38.08] of x a so that's the change in the
[40:41.28] displacement vector
[40:47.36] as you make an infinitesimal change
[40:50.08] along
[40:50.56] the geodesic
[41:17.12] so it's like a velocity a relative
[41:19.52] velocity
[41:26.72] that quantity is a relative velocity
[41:30.72] and therefore following that argument we
[41:33.36] can introduce
[41:34.08] a relative acceleration quantity
[41:37.84] as the change in the change of
[41:41.12] the displacement vector as we go along
[41:44.24] the geodesic
[41:50.40] and we introduce the world's worst
[41:51.76] notation um
[41:53.84] a to the power a however we do capital a
[41:55.84] to the power a for the acceleration
[41:59.84] t c delta c so that's the change in the
[42:03.68] change
[42:04.40] of the displacement
[42:12.56] vector as you go along the geodesic well
[42:16.16] this quantity we can
[42:20.08] work on right we're taking the
[42:21.68] derivative of something which is the
[42:23.68] derivative of something
[42:25.52] and we can you know as soon as you see
[42:27.36] two derivative operators appear in
[42:28.88] differential geometry you should start b
[42:30.96] should start looking for the curvature
[42:32.40] tensor somehow
[42:34.16] well today is no exception let's go
[42:36.64] ahead and start applying this derivative
[42:38.16] operator
[42:39.36] well we're not going to do that just
[42:40.56] here firstly we use the fact that these
[42:42.32] two
[42:42.72] coordinate fields commute just to swap
[42:44.48] them around so we swap
[42:46.08] x and t
[42:57.52] so xa and ta commute
[43:06.08] and now we apply we do some leibnizing
[43:22.24] so let's liven its through that delta
[43:24.84] delta c
[43:26.24] operator
[43:34.88] and the next step we we started to get
[43:37.92] close right you know take a look at what
[43:39.52] we've got here we've got two derivative
[43:41.60] operators next to each other
[43:42.72] what's the best way to get the
[43:43.84] commutative two derivative operators
[43:45.20] when you're only got one well you add it
[43:46.56] and subtract it
[43:48.80] that's what we're going to do add and
[43:50.88] subtract the term you want to be there
[43:52.88] so we're going to do now
[44:06.84] effectively
[44:08.08] the term we wish was there and now we've
[44:11.44] got the
[44:14.40] sorry we put the term in we wish was
[44:16.00] there but we had to subtract it this
[44:17.60] gets added
[44:18.64] and now we use the fact that we got the
[44:20.56] riemann curvature tensor appearing
[44:24.00] but if you look at that expression um
[44:27.60] well
[44:31.12] we use the fact that we've got the
[44:32.32] geodesic the ta is a geodesic
[44:35.20] look at this tc delta c on ta
[44:39.28] that's great right that's the definition
[44:41.36] of a geodesic so that vanishes
[44:46.40] and now we're left with this this
[44:47.68] expression here xc delta c
[45:02.64] so by rearranging the first two terms
[45:04.88] and an implied leibniz property has been
[45:09.04] invoked then we can really get
[45:12.72] t c to be on delta c
[45:17.36] and that's the thing we want to vanish
[45:20.40] because it is again we've got to where
[45:22.56] we want to be
[45:29.12] how about that so we've related the
[45:30.96] acceleration of two infinitesimally
[45:33.04] close geodesics
[45:34.88] to the riemann curvature tensor
[45:37.92] and data that you can compute with
[45:41.36] uh just the geodesics
[45:44.96] themselves namely their tangent vectors
[45:48.32] so this is the geodesic deviation
[45:58.84] equation and
[46:00.24] a really important consequence of this
[46:02.40] is that if
[46:03.76] this acceleration is zero for all
[46:08.80] geodesic families right all nice
[46:11.84] families of geodesics
[46:16.56] well that can happen if and only if the
[46:18.32] riemann curvature tensor is zero
[46:24.64] so if you have geodesics that accelerate
[46:26.96] relative to each other that implies that
[46:28.88] the riemann curvature tensor is not zero
[46:33.52] so if there exists
[46:37.60] relatively accelerating geodesics
[46:45.84] that implies that
[46:49.52] r a b c d is not zero uh
[46:53.20] families right smooth families it's no
[46:56.24] good just to have two geodesics that
[46:57.84] accelerate relative to each other
[46:59.84] you can do that even in flat space right
[47:01.84] just pick two geodesics and make them
[47:03.68] point in crazy directions no no if you
[47:06.32] have two geodesics that are pointing in
[47:08.32] the same direction and
[47:09.52] implementationally closed then and then
[47:13.04] you know the curvature tensor is not
[47:14.48] equal to zero
[47:16.48] now the geodesic deviation equation will
[47:18.40] play an extraordinarily important role
[47:20.16] in deducing einstein's field equations
[47:24.16] however that's a subject for our next
[47:25.84] lectures
[47:28.32] the final topics for today
[47:33.60] well the final topic for today is to put
[47:37.44] is to to explain how to practically
[47:41.44] calculate
[47:42.24] the riemann curvature tensor it's all
[47:43.76] very well to play around with these
[47:45.76] abstract quantities
[47:46.88] but if we don't know how to calculate
[47:48.08] them then what good is that
[47:50.16] so i'm going to show you the most
[47:51.44] explicit down-to-earth nitty-gritty way
[47:54.16] for computing
[47:55.04] the riemann curvature tensor it's not
[47:58.00] very
[47:58.56] um not very sexy not very dramatic not
[48:02.24] very romantic
[48:03.44] way of doing it it just gets the job
[48:05.04] done there are trickier
[48:07.20] more elegant ways to compute the riemann
[48:09.76] curvature tensor however
[48:11.68] we largely won't need them in this
[48:13.60] course so
[48:17.12] instead i'll focus on the rather
[48:20.00] pedestrian approach
[48:21.20] so if you have a manifold m
[48:25.52] with a metric
[48:29.44] g a b so if you've got that data
[48:35.68] then in principle you have enough to
[48:37.12] compute the riemann curvature tensor
[48:45.04] our abcd is determined
[48:50.24] in principle uniquely
[48:54.08] per definition by the derivative
[48:56.48] operator which is itself determined by
[48:58.32] the metric
[48:59.84] but how do you do this in practice right
[49:02.32] you know how does this data get handed
[49:03.92] to you in practice
[49:05.52] well usually you'll have a coordinate
[49:09.12] system right let's face it you know
[49:10.40] we've done everything in a coordinate
[49:11.76] free way
[49:12.40] and we've done that so that we can be
[49:14.24] pretty damn sure that certain quantities
[49:16.16] are operationally meaningful or
[49:18.88] coordinate free
[49:19.92] or don't depend on the coordinate system
[49:21.52] we chose
[49:23.36] but of course whenever we do an actual
[49:24.96] computation we're going to have a
[49:26.16] coordinate system
[49:30.08] so in practice
[49:34.32] we choose coordinates
[49:38.56] now yeah there's some fancy schmancy
[49:40.40] ways of doing things without coordinates
[49:42.72] they'll get you so far but at some point
[49:44.88] at the end of the day if you don't have
[49:46.16] coordinates
[49:47.20] then you're not really doing any physics
[49:49.04] are you
[49:53.36] so in practice you've got to choose some
[49:54.80] coordinates
[49:57.52] to get the job done and in that case we
[49:59.92] can now
[50:01.68] write out the derivative operator
[50:06.40] in
[50:09.52] the coordinate system with resp with
[50:12.00] respect to the derivative of
[50:13.36] determined by this coordinate system
[50:26.00] and now it's just a matter of
[50:27.52] substitution now into our formula that
[50:29.60] we have
[50:31.92] so the first part of the riemann
[50:34.00] curvature tensor is just doing this
[50:35.44] derivative applying this derivative
[50:36.80] operator twice to your favorite dual
[50:38.40] vector field
[50:39.52] now we're in a coordinate system we can
[50:42.40] go ahead and start doing that
[50:54.00] and i'm just substituting in for the
[50:56.64] definition
[50:57.52] of the derivative operator here
[51:15.36] i've just substituted it in wherever i
[51:20.84] could
[51:23.20] and how do we get the rebound curvature
[51:25.52] tensor from this big old mess
[51:26.88] well right you have to anti-symmetrize
[51:30.64] look at the commutator
[51:36.56] and you get it by anti-symmetrizing
[51:39.84] remember the anti-symmetrizing operation
[51:42.40] divides by a factor of two so we have to
[51:43.84] multiply by two
[51:45.28] so we know that if we anti-symmetrize
[51:46.88] the thingy above
[51:48.56] then we will know what the riemann
[51:50.24] curvature tensor is
[51:53.44] so we just anti-symmetrize the the
[51:56.08] expression i've just written
[52:00.96] to get the action of the riemann
[52:03.36] curvature tensor and we get the
[52:04.72] following expression so we get -2
[52:06.80] d delta a oops
[52:16.56] and we get two times e c a
[52:21.36] b e
[52:29.28] okay so you see that a bunch of terms
[52:30.96] cancelled from the expression above
[52:33.12] getting to the expression below
[52:35.28] some of them are pretty easy to to
[52:36.80] deduce right if i anti-symmetrize the a
[52:39.36] and the b coordinates here well what's
[52:41.44] going to happen
[52:42.56] is they're going to vanish right because
[52:43.84] the partial derivatives
[52:45.60] they commute and
[52:48.96] if you work through each term in the
[52:50.72] expression here that i've
[52:52.64] of which i've partially highlighted and
[52:54.40] exploit the symmetry properties of gamma
[52:56.48] then you'll eventually convince yourself
[52:58.00] that the only two terms that are left
[52:59.52] over over
[53:00.32] are these ones in the brackets so this
[53:03.12] is
[53:10.56] this holds for all omega d
[53:15.52] so in
[53:18.64] coordinates finally
[53:23.28] we have the following expression for the
[53:24.72] riemann curvature tensor
[53:27.04] so now we really are working in the
[53:28.40] coordinate system
[53:33.76] now in this coordinate system we know
[53:35.28] what the derivative operator it is just
[53:36.72] our friend the partial derivative
[53:40.84] operator
[53:43.84] and we're just going to write out all
[53:46.48] the two
[53:47.28] all the four terms that we have up above
[54:08.64] and that's it that's actually the
[54:09.76] expression the desired expression we're
[54:11.60] in a coordinate system we can determine
[54:13.52] all of this data
[54:17.12] from the metric
[54:24.88] now it's not very nice
[54:28.80] i mean if your metric is even halfway
[54:32.40] complicated
[54:33.52] that is not an easy expression to
[54:35.36] compute in practice
[54:36.64] no one said that it was going to be easy
[54:38.40] in practice
[54:42.08] and you will have to work damn hard if
[54:44.48] you want to compute
[54:45.76] re uh rehab curvature tenses for
[54:49.60] halfway complicated manifolds and of
[54:51.60] course what everyone does is
[54:54.00] use every trick and symmetry they can to
[54:56.48] minimize the number of computations they
[54:57.92] have to do
[54:58.88] because if you just look at that
[54:59.84] expression naively how many computations
[55:02.40] do we have to do well
[55:03.84] mu nu rho and sigma run over four
[55:07.76] possible values so we've got
[55:11.32] 256 quantities that we have to compute
[55:14.72] for a four dimensional manifold but each
[55:16.96] of gamma
[55:19.36] is a quantity involving the metric
[55:22.88] and that involves a side computation
[55:24.72] okay so you've got you know 64
[55:27.28] um quantities that you have to compute
[55:31.04] first in the form of the crystal symbols
[55:33.20] but then you also have to perform this
[55:34.56] contraction of alpha so for every one of
[55:36.64] these 256
[55:38.80] uh quantities you have to perform a
[55:40.88] summation of a four
[55:42.08] auxiliary quantities so really you're
[55:43.60] doing kind of a thousand and
[55:45.60] twenty four computations to get the
[55:48.08] riemann curvature tensor
[55:50.64] and just writing collecting that data
[55:54.40] of 1024 things
[55:57.76] and summing them up is non-trivial right
[56:00.96] and if the you know a human makes it has
[56:03.68] a one percent chance of making an error
[56:05.36] then
[56:05.68] the expected number of errors you'll
[56:07.04] make in a full computation of a riemann
[56:08.88] curvature tense is something like 10.
[56:11.36] so like luckily we live in an age of
[56:13.68] computer algebra packages and we don't
[56:15.28] have to we can verify these computations
[56:18.32] automated in an automated fashion but
[56:20.64] this is the main obstruction
[56:22.16] to fully just talking about complicated
[56:24.72] manifolds
[56:26.24] right just the number of just the 256
[56:29.04] quantities we need to keep track of
[56:30.72] there are various symmetries that we
[56:32.08] already derived for the riemann
[56:33.28] curvature tensor
[56:34.72] um you know with bianchi identities and
[56:37.28] anti-symmetric properties so it's not
[56:38.80] really 256
[56:40.40] but uh it's it's still a lot right
[56:44.88] it's it's more than two
[56:54.16] and even though you may have a symmetry
[56:55.68] property i strongly encourage you to
[56:57.92] compute it
[56:58.96] the other way around if you're doing a
[57:00.40] computation by hand
[57:02.80] then i claim it's more efficient to
[57:05.28] compute
[57:06.40] all the quantities and then check the
[57:07.92] symmetry afterwards than it is to rely
[57:10.16] on the invulnerability of your
[57:12.08] derivation skills
[57:15.44] so once we have the riemann curvature
[57:16.80] tense we can get the richie tensor just
[57:18.48] by contraction
[57:19.68] and the scalar curvature by a further
[57:22.32] contraction
[57:24.00] so there it is that's that's it in all
[57:26.16] its glory
[57:27.04] the riemann curvature tensor basically
[57:29.20] in terms of the metric
[57:31.36] and sometimes there's no escape we'll
[57:34.16] have to work with this expression but
[57:35.44] often we'll try and exploit every
[57:37.04] symmetry
[57:38.32] and uh simplification trick we can to
[57:41.36] avoid
[57:42.24] working with all these these quantities
[57:43.68] separately
[57:45.84] here's a couple of tricks to end today's
[57:52.84] lecture
[57:54.24] here's some useful formulas so these
[57:57.12] will turn out to be kind of handy when
[57:58.88] working with crystal symbols
[58:01.04] and it's worth collecting them at some
[58:02.96] point
[58:05.76] and this is that point so firstly if
[58:09.44] you've got the metric
[58:11.20] you can compute in in a coordinate
[58:13.52] system
[58:14.88] you can compute as determinant because
[58:16.56] the metric is
[58:19.20] can be represented as a matrix and a
[58:21.04] matrix you can take the determinant of
[58:24.32] now
[58:34.56] there's a nice little identity you can
[58:36.08] exploit involving the inverse of a
[58:38.56] matrix
[58:39.44] and the determinant
[58:44.24] and some derivatives
[58:51.68] so it's a little exercise for you to
[58:53.44] prove this linear algebra identity
[58:57.60] so it turns out that you can relate the
[59:00.16] derivative of the determinant
[59:02.40] to the product of the inverse of a
[59:04.40] matrix and the derivative of the matrix
[59:06.08] itself
[59:07.20] okay whatever it's kind of a curious
[59:08.88] thing
[59:11.04] further
[59:14.72] you look at the right hand side and you
[59:16.24] note that that's
[59:18.56] also
[59:22.64] can be realized as the derivative of the
[59:24.40] absolute value of g
[59:25.68] with respect to x
[59:32.88] now why would you care about this little
[59:35.60] identity
[59:44.84] well
[59:46.56] the following
[59:54.72] following formula
[59:57.92] turns up pretty often it's one that
[59:59.92] involves the christopher symbols
[60:03.76] namely suppose you have a contraction of
[60:07.20] the top index of the crystal symbol in
[60:08.88] the bottom index
[60:12.24] this turns up in various places in
[60:14.00] geodesics and so on
[60:16.48] and in computing curvature various
[60:18.88] circumstances
[60:21.68] and uh the the richie
[60:26.84] tensor
[60:28.48] and we can use that little identity that
[60:31.28] we derived above
[60:37.12] to actually simplify that quantity
[60:46.80] so by above
[60:53.52] we learn that this is equal to a half
[60:57.44] one over g
[61:03.60] d dx mu g
[61:08.24] or ddx mu the log
[61:11.76] of the square root of the determinant of
[61:13.76] g well the absolute value since we're
[61:17.20] working with negative signature
[61:20.64] so because double symbols themselves
[61:22.64] require all these derivatives of the
[61:24.08] metric and so on blah blah blah blah
[61:26.24] but if you ever face ever encounter this
[61:29.36] contraction of the crystal symbols then
[61:30.96] you can compute it by
[61:32.08] arguably much less complicated uh
[61:34.56] expression first you take the
[61:35.92] determinant of the metric which is now
[61:37.68] like a number and you can differentiate
[61:40.16] the log of that
[61:43.92] so this appears as i said in the richie
[61:46.32] tensor
[61:48.08] it also appears in a quantity that will
[61:51.44] play
[61:53.04] important physical role to do with
[61:54.80] conservation equations
[62:00.64] it appears in the divergence right we've
[62:02.88] already seen the divergence
[62:06.48] of a vector field
[62:14.40] so the divergence is a quantity that
[62:16.40] will has an important role in
[62:18.08] conservation equations
[62:22.96] and if you compute the divergence in
[62:24.48] terms of the derivative operator
[62:26.24] well you're going to contract some
[62:28.48] crystal symbols
[62:30.56] and that we can use compute by
[62:35.36] our neat little formula above
[62:49.28] okay so that's just some neat little
[62:51.84] identities that
[62:53.76] come in handy now and again
[62:56.88] in discussing particular
[63:00.84] fields in space time
[63:04.64] okay but that's it for today in our next
[63:07.44] lecture we will get to start
[63:09.04] finally the discussion of einstein's
[63:10.80] general theory of relativity
[63:12.16] having spent a good 10 lectures building
[63:14.64] up the manual
[63:15.60] i guess eight eight lectures building up
[63:17.60] the mathematical
[63:18.80] foundations of differential geometry
[63:21.76] thank you very much for your time
[63:23.20] see you next time bye-bye
