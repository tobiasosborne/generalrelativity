[00:00.00] hello and welcome back to the last
[00:01.44] lecture of introduction to general
[00:02.88] relativity
[00:03.92] in today's lecture we will detail the
[00:06.32] calculations of the deflection of light
[00:08.80] by heavenly bodies for me this is one of
[00:11.68] the most spectacular predictions of
[00:13.20] general relativity that light itself
[00:15.04] is curved by the gravitational field and
[00:18.32] even more spectacular is that this
[00:20.64] curvature
[00:21.44] can be detected with terrestrial
[00:24.80] observations and was detected in fact
[00:26.72] back in 1919
[00:28.84] already so to
[00:31.36] commence the discussion of this uh
[00:34.56] calculation we should recall uh
[00:38.32] a couple of facts
[00:41.60] about the the motion or the structure of
[00:44.96] geodesics
[00:46.24] in the schwarzschild solution
[00:49.68] so we've got this energy equation so
[00:52.16] remember
[00:52.96] that we model the geodesic in the
[00:55.76] schwarzschild
[00:57.12] solution we obtained a
[01:00.32] effective one-dimensional classical
[01:02.56] mechanics model
[01:03.68] that corresponds
[01:06.96] to the geodesic coordinates
[01:11.84] the schwarzschild solution and key here
[01:15.12] is the following energy equation so by
[01:17.92] introducing
[01:19.28] uh an effective energy equation this is
[01:21.04] not the energy
[01:22.56] of the null geodesic directly um
[01:26.32] it's just an effective interpretation of
[01:30.08] this quantity for uh geodesics
[01:34.00] as a using this one-dimensional analogy
[01:37.60] one-dimensional classical mechanic
[01:39.04] analogy now for analgeodesics there's
[01:41.52] this constant kappa if you can go back
[01:43.04] and look
[01:43.52] into equation lectures 21 and 22 to
[01:46.08] understand that
[01:46.80] this constant kappa is zero for
[01:48.32] analgesics
[01:50.96] so if you look at this energy equation
[01:53.04] it looks like that of a single
[01:55.04] non-relativistic particle moving in this
[01:56.96] funny potential this kind of
[01:58.40] quartic cubic quadratic potential um
[02:01.68] and uh well we might as well isolate
[02:05.12] this effective potential
[02:06.40] just to just to emphasize this point
[02:10.64] so there's an effective radial potential
[02:13.20] that this
[02:13.76] fictitious particle is moving in and
[02:17.52] it is based on the angular
[02:21.12] effective angular momentum and the mass
[02:23.84] of
[02:24.16] the celestial body
[02:27.44] so that's some potential right so you we
[02:29.36] can plot this we so choose
[02:31.44] and what we will find is something that
[02:33.68] doesn't look unlike
[02:35.44] the kinds of potentials that you have
[02:38.48] by binding subatomic particles to nuclei
[02:44.72] so potential looks something like this
[02:47.36] goes up and
[02:48.32] decays off and uh
[02:51.52] we want to understand this potential
[02:52.88] because the radial motion
[02:55.04] is really determined by a classical
[02:57.52] particle moving in this potential
[02:59.28] so obviously it's kind of important to
[03:00.96] understand this potential
[03:02.80] and in particular there's you know one
[03:04.40] important point here in this potential
[03:05.84] namely this potential
[03:07.12] uh stationary point here and that's
[03:09.92] going to play an important role in any
[03:11.44] classical motion
[03:12.88] in this potential so if you have some
[03:14.80] classical particle radial particle
[03:17.04] you can imagine several scenarios like
[03:18.80] this radial particle
[03:20.72] this what particle zooms up the
[03:22.48] potential doesn't have enough energy to
[03:24.56] crest the potential and zooms away again
[03:26.96] that would reflect an orbit of a null
[03:28.88] geodesic that
[03:30.64] comes close to the heavenly body and
[03:32.00] then goes away or maybe the heaven
[03:34.32] the the incoming particle has enough
[03:37.12] energy to go over
[03:38.40] the potential barrier and then it decays
[03:41.76] or accelerates to negative in
[03:45.52] potential energy so in other words
[03:47.28] that's represents an analogy or desert
[03:49.36] which gets caught
[03:50.80] by this potential captured
[03:54.08] and so it's obviously very important
[03:55.60] that we uh understand where this point
[03:58.40] is
[03:59.36] that i've highlighted in yellow how can
[04:01.92] we work that out well this is now first
[04:03.92] year calculus
[04:05.04] we can just take the derivative of the
[04:07.04] effective potential
[04:08.16] and set it to zero that'll give us the
[04:09.84] stationary points there's only one
[04:11.28] stationary point which you can sort of
[04:12.80] see graphically
[04:17.12] and doing that derivative which is what
[04:18.96] i'm doing here
[04:20.40] leads us to the following equation
[04:25.60] minus three minus 2 m plus r
[04:29.92] and well you know this goes away right
[04:32.96] for solving
[04:33.92] for the for the maxima or for the
[04:36.40] extrema
[04:37.52] and we learned that the maxima
[04:41.20] is at r equals 3m
[04:45.76] so what does that tell us well for large
[04:48.72] masses
[04:49.60] you know suppose m goes asymptotically
[04:51.84] towards infinity it can't internal
[04:53.28] relativity but suppose
[04:55.04] then uh analogy it is again the presence
[04:58.00] of a large mass will clearly be strongly
[04:59.92] affected right because this maximum is
[05:01.44] very high and so
[05:02.72] you have um uh and then
[05:06.08] the potential will spread out and so
[05:08.40] this will
[05:09.84] lead to very noticeable effects to the
[05:11.36] propagation of null geodesics
[05:16.00] so i'll just indicate on this plot that
[05:17.60] this is the point 3 m
[05:19.44] and you know for scale i'll sort of put
[05:21.52] on a couple of other points
[05:23.68] there we go
[05:28.48] now uh we want to understand in the rest
[05:32.08] of this video
[05:33.04] how does analog geodesic propagate in
[05:36.24] the presence of
[05:37.20] such a uh in the presence of a heavenly
[05:40.24] body
[05:40.88] so for that um to set up the the
[05:44.16] scenario here we have a heavenly body
[05:45.68] like the sun
[05:48.08] and we have a geodesic so there's all
[05:51.04] sorts of scenarios but those scenarios
[05:52.88] we're going to focus on here is we'll
[05:54.24] focus on scattering type scenarios
[06:06.16] so that's our goal for the rest of the
[06:07.52] lecture so scattering type scenario you
[06:09.20] know you have
[06:10.56] uh infinite sort of infinitely far away
[06:13.44] t
[06:13.68] equals minus infinity you have an
[06:15.20] incoming
[06:18.00] null geodesic and then that's not
[06:20.16] affected by
[06:21.04] the schwarzschild uh geometry infinitely
[06:23.68] far away this right shot geometry is
[06:25.12] asymptotically flat
[06:26.64] and as this knowledge does it comes
[06:28.40] towards the heavenly body
[06:30.24] the geodesic is going to be affected by
[06:32.88] the curvature of the schwarzschild
[06:34.24] solution
[06:35.04] and will be deflected and then
[06:36.80] infinitely far away in the future
[06:40.40] it'll propagate eventually in a straight
[06:42.08] line again
[06:44.48] and to understand this type of scenario
[06:47.52] it's very convenient
[06:48.88] not to use the position of the the
[06:52.96] particle or photon in this case but to
[06:55.28] actually use a slightly different
[06:56.72] parameter
[06:57.44] to measure the relative position of
[07:00.48] the incoming analgesic and the heavenly
[07:03.52] body
[07:04.72] and so for that we're going to set up a
[07:06.56] coordinate called the impact parameter
[07:08.48] and but to do that first we'll have to
[07:11.36] talk a little bit about asymptotic
[07:12.96] flatness
[07:14.96] and identify which constants
[07:18.32] in these solutions correspond to what
[07:21.44] impact parameters and how to define them
[07:24.64] so the first step is to define uh
[07:30.00] uh to identify inside the constants l
[07:32.96] and e
[07:33.44] inside our governing equation for the
[07:35.04] geodesic uh an
[07:36.64] important other constant namely we
[07:38.96] notice that
[07:40.24] l divided by e represents the distance
[07:42.96] of closest approach
[07:44.00] to the center
[07:47.36] i'll argue how to show that i'll show
[07:49.20] you how to argue that in a second
[08:08.88] all right so here's how you might argue
[08:10.40] this it's not so difficult
[08:12.48] so you know you go to a coordinate
[08:14.08] system where the heavenly bodies at
[08:17.20] well we're using just simply
[08:23.12] polar coordinates so the black line here
[08:26.56] is a uh
[08:31.12] geodesic this is in the case where m is
[08:34.72] naught
[08:35.44] so i should put that up here
[08:40.56] so
[08:43.60] suppose m is not so we've got a flat a
[08:45.52] flat geometry so we have the heavenly
[08:47.52] body here at the
[08:48.48] center of the coordinate system
[08:55.44] and you imagine a geodesic propagating
[08:57.68] along
[09:00.40] a photon moving along this geodesic
[09:03.68] and you specify the position of this
[09:06.24] photon with a radius and a
[09:09.60] angle variable phi and then
[09:12.64] you note that the position of closest
[09:15.36] approach
[09:16.48] is here with the intersection of the
[09:18.00] geodesic and the coordinate y axis
[09:20.32] in yellow um
[09:24.96] this y intersect is at r naught that's
[09:27.52] the position of closest approach
[09:29.60] and uh x is equal to t that's the actual
[09:32.48] trajectory so the
[09:33.92] the trajectory itself follows has these
[09:37.20] coordinates as a function of time
[09:38.80] y is always r naught and x is equal to t
[09:42.48] and then you uh you can
[09:45.68] calculate l divided by e or r squared
[09:48.80] times by d phi dt for the solution
[09:51.04] and then you set uh you find that the
[09:53.20] time point when
[09:54.40] the trajectory is intersecting the y
[09:56.48] axis and you'll find that l divided by e
[09:58.24] and d
[09:58.56] gives r naught so that's uh
[10:01.84] that that gives us that interpretation
[10:04.40] that the case
[10:06.08] m is naught now uh
[10:10.64] l divided by e does not necessarily
[10:13.68] uh equal the position
[10:17.20] of closest approach
[10:21.44] for a curved geometry however
[10:27.76] as mentioned several times the
[10:30.48] schwarzschild
[10:31.36] solution or geometry
[10:34.88] is asymptotically flat
[10:47.68] and so by the way i should have stressed
[10:49.20] this
[10:50.72] l divided by e equals r naught no matter
[10:53.44] what
[10:53.84] t is in this flat case here
[11:00.88] so in particular l divided by e equals r
[11:03.84] naught when the trajectory is infinitely
[11:05.52] far away
[11:06.16] from the scattering center or the
[11:07.68] heavenly body
[11:09.76] now the schwarzschild geometry is
[11:12.24] asymptotically flat so when you're
[11:13.60] infinitely far away from the heavenly
[11:15.20] body
[11:15.92] then you
[11:20.16] you can interpret everything as you
[11:21.84] would for a flat geometry
[11:24.96] so in particular for a light ray
[11:30.48] photon
[11:33.84] very far from the origin
[11:41.44] so r is much bigger than the the m
[11:44.56] parameter the constant
[11:49.12] l divided by e represents an apparent
[11:54.32] impact parameter so one thing i should
[11:56.00] say is that r naught here
[11:59.84] is what we call an impact parameter
[12:11.76] r naught is an impact parameter what
[12:13.20] does that mean it means a displacement
[12:15.04] relative
[12:15.84] to so you imagine the scattering uh
[12:18.40] trajectory
[12:19.36] and you measure the the distance
[12:22.56] of the closest approach of the
[12:25.44] scattering trajectory to your target and
[12:27.20] that represents
[12:28.08] your impact parameter
[12:31.52] how we define the impact parameter
[12:35.36] now uh for the
[12:40.48] schwarzschild geometry when m is not
[12:42.96] zero
[12:43.76] uh we can by thinking
[12:47.12] asymptotically imagining that the the
[12:49.20] like impinging
[12:50.40] light ray is infinitely far away from
[12:52.96] the
[12:53.52] heavenly body we can hereby interpret
[12:56.96] therefore the constant
[12:58.08] l divided by e as an apparent
[13:05.44] impact parameter
[13:16.48] so b we'll call it b l b is
[13:19.52] l divided by e
[13:28.56] and so b this constant l divided by e
[13:31.20] represents sort of the distance between
[13:33.28] the the axis which
[13:37.04] runs right through the center of the
[13:38.16] heavenly body and the
[13:40.08] impingement trajectory
[13:46.40] and so now imagine you look at the
[13:48.72] heavenly body and you are a light ray
[13:55.92] so there's the heavenly body and you are
[13:57.52] the light ray and you are impingement on
[13:59.60] this
[14:00.56] uh celeste your body so you're
[14:02.00] infinitely far away you're looking at it
[14:04.16] and you're you're heading towards it
[14:06.00] of course no time passes right you're on
[14:07.84] the library so this
[14:09.28] but uh whatever invoke your imagination
[14:12.72] that you are a light ray
[14:13.92] and then you are you could depending on
[14:16.80] how far away you are from the scattering
[14:18.40] center of this
[14:19.36] heavenly body
[14:22.72] you are in when you're infinitely far
[14:26.08] away the scattering center is a distance
[14:28.84] b
[14:30.40] equals l divided by e effectively
[14:33.52] away from your uh initial
[14:36.56] trajectory so you imagine your light ray
[14:39.84] trajectory heads
[14:41.52] parallel to the axis running through the
[14:43.76] heavenly body
[14:44.72] and b measures the distance displacement
[14:47.36] of
[14:47.76] the impingement axis uh trajectory from
[14:50.48] this axis
[14:51.36] as the light ray gets closer of course
[14:53.12] to the heavenly body so this circle with
[14:54.72] a cross in it means
[14:55.76] the the sort of the target point that
[14:57.52] the light ray is would effectively
[14:59.84] hit if there was no curved geometry
[15:06.56] now it's important to note that right
[15:09.20] because
[15:10.40] the geometry is curved this effective
[15:13.12] distance will
[15:14.00] be closed once the trajectory gets close
[15:16.24] to the heavenly body because
[15:17.52] the geometry affects the geodesic and it
[15:20.64] could be that the
[15:21.60] particle gets trapped or not by
[15:24.80] this heavenly body right it depends on
[15:26.72] on this radial motion
[15:28.72] so if you go back to here to this is
[15:29.92] this radial potential if you are
[15:32.16] if the radial uh energy is insufficient
[15:35.52] to crest this
[15:36.64] maxima then the the impingement
[15:39.28] trajectory will come
[15:40.48] in and uh be affected by the celestial
[15:44.32] body and fly away
[15:45.92] however for energies greater than
[15:52.16] actually i don't like this wobbly circle
[15:53.76] draw a real circle
[15:56.40] if you have an energy greater than
[16:00.00] vf maxima
[16:06.40] so if the incoming
[16:10.88] light ray has
[16:15.52] energy half e squared
[16:18.96] greater than v f
[16:22.08] v max which is 3m
[16:25.92] then it is
[16:29.12] captured right
[16:32.64] so that's defined by this red circle
[16:35.92] here so any
[16:37.36] as we'll see any light incoming light
[16:39.52] ray that has an energy
[16:42.24] bigger than uh enough to to crest the
[16:45.12] the radial potential maxima
[16:47.92] will be these energies will be defined
[16:50.88] by a circle the circle won't have
[16:52.56] necessarily have the same radius as the
[16:54.16] celestial body
[16:55.52] and then you will find that if your
[16:58.40] impact parameter lies within this red
[17:00.08] circle
[17:00.64] then you will be captured and so this is
[17:03.04] this red circle has a name
[17:05.36] and the area of that circle is very
[17:07.04] important and that's called the impact
[17:09.44] the the cross section
[17:12.88] so because some trajectories
[17:22.80] they can reach r equals zero and hence
[17:25.68] be captured
[17:33.44] we estimate this capture area
[17:38.64] or capture radius
[17:42.96] or capture
[17:46.08] cross section
[17:53.92] of the object
[17:58.72] so this is ie area
[18:02.16] of the target
[18:05.60] that captures
[18:08.64] geodesic
[18:13.12] and that area we traditionally use the
[18:15.20] symbol signal the scattering the sigma
[18:16.88] in scattering theory for this area and
[18:18.56] it's
[18:18.88] pi times the capture radius squared so
[18:21.76] the
[18:22.08] capture radius is b c squared
[18:25.12] and to to calculate bc the capture
[18:28.24] radius and therefore the red circle so
[18:30.00] this is the red circle
[18:34.80] so the red circle is the effective sort
[18:37.12] of
[18:38.00] target area where an incoming nonzero
[18:40.80] design will be captured by
[18:42.00] the heavenly body
[18:46.00] and how do we we want to calculate now
[18:47.60] bc and to do that we've got to relate bc
[18:49.68] to the energy and that energy better be
[18:51.52] bigger than the maximum of the radial
[18:53.60] uh effective potential
[19:08.80] okay so we need to know the height of
[19:10.16] the maximum potential
[19:14.56] so a half e squared has got to equal
[19:18.00] the potential at the maximum that's when
[19:20.00] the radius is three times
[19:22.84] m
[19:24.72] and that equals a little calculation
[19:27.20] later
[19:29.84] l squared m divided by two times
[19:33.04] three m cubed
[19:41.28] and uh well we need to work out what is
[19:43.76] the the b
[19:44.72] parameter not the e you know it's all
[19:46.32] very well to have e but what well
[19:48.24] uh we want b well b is uh defined to be
[19:52.64] l divided by e right so we just need to
[19:54.32] rearrange this equation to find l
[19:55.84] divided by e's
[19:57.68] and that's super easy here because you
[20:00.72] can already see there's an e squared on
[20:02.08] one side and an l squared on the other
[20:04.24] and we end up with this equation l
[20:07.04] squared divided by e squared equals
[20:09.12] 27 m squared uh
[20:12.24] and that tells us that b c is
[20:15.52] root three or three to the three halves
[20:22.40] times m
[20:26.32] so now we know the apparent in and thus
[20:29.12] now we know the apparent impact radius
[20:31.60] capture radius if you like of this
[20:33.36] heavenly body
[20:35.68] and now we can work out the impact cross
[20:37.84] section sigma to be
[20:39.44] 27 pi m squared so the bigger the m
[20:42.80] the larger the cross section and so for
[20:45.76] something like a black hole solution
[20:47.44] which we won't be able to cover in an
[20:48.56] introductory course on general
[20:49.76] relativity but which is indeed covered
[20:51.84] uh which is indeed uh modeled by
[20:54.80] schwarzschild solution
[20:56.40] you can see that the larger m the the
[20:58.64] larger this
[20:59.76] capture cross section that such a
[21:03.52] celestial body will have
[21:06.72] now trajectories whose impact parameter
[21:09.84] or impact effective impact distance
[21:13.52] which exceed this bc capture radius
[21:18.00] well they they won't be captured right
[21:25.12] so if you're heading towards a black
[21:26.56] hole and b
[21:28.48] is bigger than bc then you won't be
[21:30.00] sucked in
[21:34.72] now our goal is
[21:38.16] to understand how much you're deflected
[21:40.08] by
[21:42.16] as you zoom past this massive celestial
[21:46.00] object
[21:47.36] and you are analogy to think
[21:51.52] so for that we want to uh understand the
[21:54.64] the value of the angular parameter phi
[21:57.52] is a function
[21:58.00] of the radius parameter well from
[22:00.40] lecture 22
[22:01.44] we actually obtained this formula
[22:13.20] and we can
[22:15.00] [Music]
[22:16.80] study this this uh this quantity and
[22:20.88] try and understand how much total
[22:23.84] deflection
[22:24.64] a incoming trajectory will experience
[22:27.84] so if we go back to the the picture here
[22:30.08] i have of the scattering setup
[22:32.08] so here here comes the the particle
[22:34.40] comes in
[22:36.00] and then it has some we want to
[22:38.00] understand
[22:39.12] what's the the total angle
[22:42.16] phi deflection
[22:46.00] that's our goal now just to work out
[22:52.32] delta phi which measures the total angle
[22:54.88] of deflection
[22:56.08] of the knowledge as it zooms past the
[22:59.04] heavenly body
[23:21.60] so the goal is to calculate total
[23:23.04] angular shift total angular deflection
[23:24.96] how does that define well just work out
[23:27.04] your radial variable for
[23:30.16] tau is plus infinity this is your affine
[23:32.40] parameter
[23:33.36] and subtract from it the angle when tau
[23:35.92] is minus infinity
[23:37.12] and that's your total deflection
[23:49.60] now for such trajectories the turning
[23:52.08] point
[23:56.72] is at a radial coordinate r equals
[23:59.92] r naught and r naught well
[24:03.12] we can work that out in a second
[24:07.60] and we the way we can work out r naught
[24:09.44] is we can go back to this radial
[24:11.12] potential
[24:12.16] here so remember here's the radial
[24:14.48] potential experienced by
[24:15.84] the effective particle and you have an
[24:18.64] incoming trajectory
[24:20.64] and then it comes up it doesn't have
[24:21.92] enough energy to crest the
[24:24.00] potential and that turning point here
[24:26.08] that's r naught
[24:31.44] we want to work out r naught how do we
[24:34.40] work out r naught well r naught is when
[24:36.00] the energy equals
[24:37.36] the effective potential energy
[24:49.36] and we
[24:52.48] have ourselves
[24:57.44] by rearranging we bring the energy over
[25:00.08] through
[25:00.64] to the right hand side so that we can
[25:03.44] replace
[25:04.00] l squared divided by e squared with the
[25:05.36] impact parameter squared
[25:11.84] and then well we do a little bit more
[25:13.68] rearranging to get an equation
[25:17.76] which we'll call equation one
[25:21.36] it should get a cubic equation for this
[25:23.12] turning point
[25:29.44] so we've got to find the zero of a cubic
[25:31.84] polynomial equation you can do that
[25:34.64] it is analytically solvable up to
[25:37.28] quartic equations you can find these
[25:38.88] zeros
[25:41.68] and uh well i'll just quote the answer
[25:44.64] to you
[25:45.84] because it's a pain
[25:57.52] so the the largest radius for which the
[26:01.12] potential equals the total energy is the
[26:03.76] largest zero
[26:06.80] of that cubic polynomial
[26:10.16] and i'll just quote that i mean you
[26:11.52] could work it out numerically if you
[26:12.72] want or you can just believe me
[26:14.96] that it is 2b root 3 cos
[26:18.80] one third arc cos
[26:22.84] minus three to the three halves
[26:26.80] m on b
[26:31.52] so that's okay you can believe me and
[26:34.32] now
[26:34.88] um now that we have the the
[26:38.08] turning point that's the
[26:41.12] distance the closest distance of the
[26:43.12] trajectory to the heavenly body
[26:45.04] we can go ahead and solve this
[26:46.24] differential equation here so this
[26:48.56] differential equation uh
[26:52.08] is the one that will allow us to compute
[26:54.72] the total angular shift
[27:00.24] that's the one we want to integrate now
[27:01.76] actually
[27:03.84] the total angular shift is we're just
[27:05.20] going to integrate both sides and then
[27:06.64] set
[27:07.76] input the limits we know that when tau
[27:11.20] is minus infinity r is minus infinity
[27:13.36] r is infinity and so on
[27:37.52] uh this this equation here takes a
[27:39.28] little justifying right so
[27:40.56] we're going to integrate this equation
[27:42.80] uh from
[27:44.24] the point of closest the radius of
[27:46.24] closest approach to
[27:47.36] infinity now i put a 2 in front of there
[27:50.48] why is that well
[27:51.60] you've got two parts to this angular
[27:54.64] shift differential equation so if you
[27:56.88] look at the first
[27:58.08] epoch right the analogy does it's
[28:00.32] getting closer closer closer closer
[28:01.60] closer
[28:02.00] until it reaches the point r
[28:05.04] equals r naught of closest approach
[28:08.56] and then it gets further and out now if
[28:11.04] you imagine the angular shift
[28:12.56] generated part through this trajectory
[28:14.40] well the angular shift
[28:16.00] uh adds up right as you come in it gets
[28:19.20] more and more and more and then
[28:20.64] you've got a symmetric um epoch where
[28:23.36] the particle is now
[28:24.48] exiting the potential well the
[28:27.04] gravitational well
[28:28.32] and there the angular deflection just
[28:30.96] adds up so we get twice the angular
[28:32.80] deflection
[28:33.60] we get a contribution when the radius
[28:35.28] comes in to
[28:37.04] r naught and we have a contribution from
[28:38.80] when the radius goes from r naught back
[28:40.40] to r equals infinity again that's why
[28:42.16] there's a two here
[28:44.72] at the front of this integral so this
[28:46.24] integral is just literally integrating
[28:48.56] this yellow boxed expression on the
[28:52.00] right hand side
[28:55.76] so it's symmetric about
[29:02.72] i equals r
[29:06.72] and now okay so this is a bit of
[29:08.40] painless integral um
[29:10.48] you just have to believe me
[29:14.00] or work it out that you know making the
[29:17.36] following
[29:18.16] substitution is a good thing to do
[29:28.08] makes it look a tad easier
[29:36.16] but this integral is not trivial
[29:39.28] one thing we can do however is set m
[29:42.56] is zero and just as a sanity check you
[29:45.52] know what happens when m is zero
[29:52.40] well when m is zero we have flat space
[29:54.16] time and we calculate
[29:56.00] as an exercise that uh the total angular
[29:59.68] shift
[30:02.80] is pi okay as it should be right when
[30:05.28] you come in
[30:06.16] if you look at now the trajectory of a
[30:09.12] null geodesic in the flat
[30:11.04] case well phi goes from minus
[30:17.12] pi to pi
[30:30.40] and since we've defined the angular
[30:32.40] shift in the way that we have here
[30:34.24] you can see that the total angular shift
[30:36.56] is pi
[30:52.56] now let's investigate delta phi as a
[30:55.28] function of m
[30:56.40] right we really want to understand
[30:57.60] what's the angular shift
[30:59.44] in the case where uh we
[31:04.24] are interested in
[31:07.68] realistic celestial bodies like the sun
[31:10.08] or something like that
[31:17.44] well it's non-trivial
[31:32.40] that's because this limit
[31:40.00] becomes singular
[31:47.92] at m equals zero
[31:51.20] which is a pain right because if you
[31:52.56] want to expand around the smallness of
[31:54.56] m and something becomes singular at the
[31:56.40] thing that you're expanding around then
[31:57.60] the taylor series approximation doesn't
[31:59.20] work exactly there
[32:01.52] so we're going to avoid this uh in the
[32:03.68] following way
[32:05.52] we promote instead so this is
[32:08.88] interrelationship between m and r naught
[32:10.64] but instead what we're going to do is we
[32:11.92] promote
[32:12.48] m and r naught to independent variables
[32:15.60] and then we will do our expansion and
[32:17.68] then we'll set
[32:19.12] we'll fix uh m to be equal to r naught
[32:23.36] m to depend on r naught in the correct
[32:26.84] fashion
[32:33.92] so we'll compare delta phi which is now
[32:37.04] a function of m and r naught
[32:57.68] and we'll compare this angular
[32:58.96] deflection for light rays with the same
[33:01.36] r naught
[33:10.48] the first step is to eliminate b
[33:13.52] via equation one right so equation one
[33:15.60] up here is the equation for the turning
[33:17.04] point
[33:18.80] and that tells us that b is a function
[33:20.72] of r naught and m
[33:24.00] that gives us a total angular deflection
[33:26.24] to be 2
[33:27.52] 0 goes from integral goes from 0 to 1
[33:31.36] over r naught
[33:33.28] so substituting in that value of b
[33:44.80] gives us this nasty looking thing
[33:49.76] and now the goal is to expand
[33:54.72] we've gotten rid of b out of the story
[33:57.52] now so we're going to expand
[34:00.00] delta phi as a function of
[34:03.68] the smallest as the taylor series and
[34:06.32] the smallest of
[34:07.04] m
[34:19.44] so i've just drawn the first two terms
[34:20.96] of a taylor series well we already know
[34:22.32] what the zeroth order term is it's pi
[34:27.52] so we need to work out the the first
[34:30.32] order correction and for that we need to
[34:31.68] do
[34:32.56] this derivative
[34:36.24] of this angular deflection as a function
[34:38.72] of m and set it to m is zero
[34:41.68] remembering that we've decoupled m and r
[34:43.60] naught right
[34:45.28] by making r naught independent
[34:59.20] and that's a you know somewhat tedious
[35:01.84] derivative we'll just pass the
[35:03.12] derivative
[35:03.76] with respect to m through the integral
[35:14.84] sign
[35:21.84] and this simplifies a little a little
[35:28.84] bit
[35:30.72] by substituting or using the
[35:33.12] relationship between
[35:34.08] r naught and the impact parameter
[35:43.60] we arrive at the following much simpler
[35:46.56] expression
[35:47.12] 4 divided by b and so here we've used
[35:49.60] something right we've used the fact
[35:51.52] that um r naught equals b
[35:54.64] naught so there's you know a kind of
[35:56.72] warning warning here right
[35:58.16] what's happened here i've changed r
[35:59.84] naught for b naught
[36:01.76] um well we've used
[36:07.20] the following taylor series
[36:18.96] so if you remember we've got this
[36:26.96] equation here that uh sets
[36:30.16] r naught as a function of b if you look
[36:32.08] at this for long enough you
[36:34.80] should see that r naught is effectively
[36:36.64] determined by b in this equation
[36:38.84] and we want to understand that
[36:42.08] to lowest order in m
[36:45.76] there's m features there as well so
[36:47.44] we've used the fact that when you take
[36:49.04] cos of the third of r cos of x
[36:51.52] then that equals root 3 over 2
[36:54.56] the first couple of terms in the taylor
[36:56.00] series plus x over 6 minus x squared
[36:59.04] over 12 root 3 blah blah blah blah
[37:02.16] so using um the fact that r naught
[37:05.44] is 2 b over root three
[37:09.04] so r naught is two b over root three cos
[37:12.64] one third
[37:13.44] arc cos of this argument there
[37:17.76] we can obtain a relationship correct to
[37:20.56] first order
[37:21.36] in m of the inter relationship between
[37:25.12] r naught and b
[37:34.00] and this equals b minus three m so to
[37:37.52] zeroth order r naught is b right
[37:53.68] and so to order m we've just learned
[37:57.36] that delta phi
[37:59.36] is approximately pi
[38:02.56] plus 4 m over b and this is the
[38:05.20] correction
[38:06.80] so before we continue with the
[38:08.80] correction i should just pause
[38:10.72] to distinguish
[38:13.84] two angular deflections that have
[38:16.32] appeared in this lecture
[38:17.76] so delta phi is the total change
[38:21.20] in angular variable throughout the
[38:24.76] trajectory's
[38:30.84] lifetime
[38:51.20] all right so delta phi is a very simple
[38:52.80] thing to interpret it's just the total
[38:54.24] angular
[38:55.04] change of the trajectory and so that's
[38:58.00] why
[38:58.72] when for flat space time the total
[39:01.20] angular change is simply pi
[39:02.56] right you go from phi
[39:05.76] is effectively zero through to pi
[39:08.80] or phi is minus pi over two to pi over
[39:11.20] two depending on where you set the zero
[39:12.48] to pi
[39:13.76] now there's an additional angular change
[39:16.32] which
[39:17.28] in the figure up here i had written as
[39:21.52] uh big delta phi but actually i should
[39:23.68] have written it as little delta pi
[39:25.44] there's an additional angular shift due
[39:27.68] to the curvature of the
[39:29.12] geodesic and that
[39:32.72] is this correction factor and that is
[39:35.20] delta phi
[39:37.20] little delta phi just so that we don't
[39:40.16] confuse our notations
[39:41.92] so for a trajectory moving in a
[39:45.92] small celestial body such as the sun
[39:49.44] there is or can be a perceptible
[39:52.64] correction to the total angular variable
[39:55.44] change
[39:56.00] throughout a trajectory's lifetime so
[40:00.48] for example for a light ray
[40:03.76] grazing or touching the edge of the sun
[40:11.04] uh this this correction
[40:14.88] is about um
[40:19.40] 1.75 seconds of arc
[40:23.12] so it's just about perceptible
[40:26.96] uh it was uh confirmed in 1919
[40:31.84] although the error bars have always been
[40:33.52] pretty high on this
[40:34.96] sort of experiment
[40:38.08] and this was by the dyson eddington
[40:40.40] davidson
[40:42.80] collaboration uh the this is
[40:46.16] difficult to uh get the error bars down
[40:50.08] because the sun
[40:50.96] is such a bright emitter in the sky um
[40:53.76] in fact it's far better to look at the
[40:55.36] bending of radio waves
[40:58.64] by uh from quasars
[41:01.68] there you can get the error bars a lot
[41:03.68] further down and so these predictions
[41:05.28] have been
[41:08.32] confirmed
[41:11.36] by experiments
[41:22.08] give better confirmation
[41:28.24] so that's it for this lecture and indeed
[41:30.88] for this course
[41:32.24] thank you for joining me on this journey
[41:34.96] through
[41:35.52] uh einstein's general theory of
[41:38.24] relativity
[41:39.52] i hope you'll agree with me that it's an
[41:41.20] extraordinary theory
[41:42.64] that is that has a level of beauty that
[41:45.52] is unparalleled by
[41:47.20] many other theories in physics we've
[41:49.76] only really scratched the surface
[41:51.60] of the general theory of relativity
[41:53.76] there's been active
[41:54.64] research in this area since the early
[41:57.36] 20s
[41:58.48] and that's nearly a century of active
[42:00.88] research
[42:01.52] on uh einstein's general theory of
[42:03.92] relativity
[42:04.72] and there's now an immense amount of
[42:06.56] things known and an immense number of
[42:08.48] interesting and fascinating topics
[42:10.56] and these problems are of ever greater
[42:13.84] significance as we understand
[42:16.64] and perform better cosmological
[42:19.28] observations of our universe
[42:20.56] universe and in fact in a way the
[42:22.96] largest mysteries that remain open in
[42:24.72] physics are those
[42:25.76] that arise in general relativity and
[42:28.84] cosmology
[42:30.08] but that's it for today and for this
[42:33.12] course
[42:33.76] thank you for joining me and i'll see
[42:36.40] you hopefully next time
[42:37.84] goodbye
