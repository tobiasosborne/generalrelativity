[00:00.08] hello and welcome back to introduction
[00:01.84] to general relativity
[00:03.12] in today's lecture we're going to take a
[00:04.80] look at cosmology
[00:07.36] and namely space times with homogeneity
[00:10.00] and isotropy
[00:11.04] and we're going to attempt to set up the
[00:14.56] equations of such a homogeneous and
[00:17.20] isotropic space time
[00:18.64] in order that we in the next lecture
[00:21.04] solve einstein's equations or
[00:22.72] move to the solution of einstein's
[00:24.40] equations in this cosmological context
[00:28.88] so if you recall from the previous
[00:30.80] lecture we introduced the notions of
[00:33.04] homogeneity
[00:34.24] and isotropy and today
[00:37.76] we're going to take those discussions
[00:39.52] and implement them at the level of the
[00:42.84] metric
[00:44.16] so suppose our manifold m modeling
[00:47.60] space time modeling the entire universe
[00:56.96] let's suppose that our space time is
[00:59.76] homogeneous and isotropic
[01:11.60] so the con the question now is what
[01:13.68] consequences does that have for the
[01:15.52] fundamental degree of freedom
[01:16.80] that we need to describe our spacetime
[01:18.72] namely the metric
[01:27.76] so the metric gab is the fundamental
[01:31.68] fundamental a dynamical variable that
[01:33.52] we're solving for in general relativity
[01:37.52] and that's our goal today to work out if
[01:40.24] what if any
[01:41.12] are there consequences of homogeneity
[01:43.04] isotropy for the metric
[01:44.56] now our the hope here is that by
[01:47.28] assuming the symmetries of homogenating
[01:49.36] isotropy the metric gets simplified
[01:51.68] and when you simplify something you can
[01:53.76] throw away degrees of freedom that you
[01:55.36] have to
[01:57.60] take into a consideration so that the
[01:59.92] problem that you have to solve the
[02:01.20] einstein's field equations
[02:02.72] hopefully becomes simpler indeed of
[02:04.40] course it does
[02:08.00] to work out these consequences it's very
[02:10.16] helpful
[02:12.48] um to restrict
[02:15.84] the metric the general
[02:19.20] metric of space-time
[02:22.64] g a b we want to restrict that
[02:26.56] to a three dimensional metric
[02:30.40] h a b depending on t
[02:34.32] on these surfaces sigma t that we
[02:37.04] introduced in the previous lecture
[02:41.20] so it's a really important uh device
[02:44.40] that we're going to employ now we're
[02:45.52] going to instead of looking firstly at
[02:46.96] the full metric gab we're going to
[02:48.24] instead
[02:48.88] look at the three-dimensional induced
[02:50.64] metric on sigma t
[02:54.00] and study the consequences of
[02:56.40] homogeneity and isotropy
[02:58.64] for this induced metric and then later
[03:00.80] we will
[03:03.36] embed the metric h a b back into g a b
[03:06.80] and then argue that we don't have to add
[03:08.88] that many extra degrees of freedom
[03:13.68] all right then let's take a look at
[03:15.12] homogeneity what does this mean
[03:17.92] for the metric hab the induced
[03:20.16] three-dimensional metric
[03:21.92] h-a-b well it means that there exists an
[03:25.44] isometry
[03:28.32] of h-a-b so diphymorphism that preserves
[03:31.76] the
[03:33.20] the metric which takes
[03:38.64] any point p
[03:42.00] in this surface sigma t hyper surface
[03:45.44] sigma t
[03:46.40] to another point q in sigma t that's
[03:49.12] what homogeneity means
[03:50.80] and isotropy what does it mean
[03:55.92] there exists an isometry
[04:01.28] of h a b well i should put t everywhere
[04:03.76] but when i forget to put t then
[04:05.44] i'm still talking about h e b restricted
[04:07.20] to sigma t
[04:08.96] um no we're not
[04:12.84] isotropy we can phrase it differently
[04:16.08] isotropy implies that it is impossible
[04:24.88] to construct a geometrically preferred
[04:27.36] vector
[04:39.28] in big sigma t
[04:43.60] now we're going to take aim at the
[04:45.12] second constraint first of all
[04:47.12] and then uh use homogeneity
[04:50.16] later and the way we're going to take
[04:53.20] aim at the second constraint is we're
[04:54.56] going to try and
[04:56.16] we're going to try and build a
[04:57.36] geometrically preferred vector on sigma
[04:59.84] t
[05:00.80] there's a handful of ways where you
[05:02.32] could do this and
[05:03.92] i will go through in detail one style of
[05:06.64] argumentation which would
[05:08.00] in principle select out a geometrically
[05:10.32] preferred vector on sigma t
[05:12.16] and then by arguing that that can't be
[05:14.00] the case we will
[05:16.40] uh infer a very very
[05:19.52] substantial simplification of the metric
[05:21.04] h a b
[05:22.72] all right so
[05:27.04] here it goes the second constraint
[05:30.72] namely isotropy
[05:36.84] uh implies the following
[05:43.44] so what we're going to do is we're going
[05:45.60] to
[05:48.72] we'll build a uh
[05:52.08] riemann tensor
[05:58.16] for sigma t as follows right we just
[06:00.40] take the metric
[06:04.00] h a b
[06:10.32] and we build the riemann tensor
[06:12.16] following the rules of the previous
[06:13.44] lectures
[06:14.00] this is the beauty of having done all
[06:16.40] this hard work in the past
[06:18.16] 12 lectures or so we can just
[06:21.44] uh by doing all that hard work in
[06:23.44] arbitrary space-time dimensions we can
[06:25.36] do these kind of tricks without having
[06:26.64] to add any kind of argument we just say
[06:28.24] here's a metric on a three-dimensional
[06:30.24] manifold just construct the riemann
[06:32.80] tensor and now you know what that means
[06:37.20] so we construct the riemann tensor and
[06:38.64] we got to give it distinguish it somehow
[06:40.16] from the renal tensor of our spacetime m
[06:42.00] and so we put this little
[06:42.96] brackets three of the top left
[06:44.72] superscript
[06:47.20] now we can raise the index
[06:50.72] c if we so like
[06:57.60] and then we get this object here
[07:00.72] r a b c d which is just defined to be
[07:05.52] r a b c prime d h c
[07:08.64] prime c so that's just the raised i've
[07:11.12] just raised an index on
[07:12.32] our three dimensional riemann curvature
[07:14.84] tensor
[07:16.32] and the reason we did this is we can
[07:20.32] interpret i mean we could have
[07:22.40] interpreted it before but whatever
[07:24.08] this makes it much more explicit we can
[07:26.72] interpret this
[07:28.80] as a linear map
[07:34.48] so our three-dimensional riemann test is
[07:37.36] now interpreted as a linear map
[07:39.28] from a subspace
[07:42.72] well first of all it's from zero to
[07:47.04] two tenses of type zero two and that
[07:50.32] much is
[07:50.96] pretty much clear uh
[07:55.84] at a point p at any point p
[08:01.28] now there's something kind of remarkable
[08:03.12] about this linear map
[08:05.04] that is that it not only um
[08:08.32] maps from tensors of type zero two to
[08:10.08] type zero two but also
[08:12.48] takes the subspace of anti-symmetric
[08:14.56] tenses of type zero two to itself
[08:17.20] so it preserves the subspace so that's a
[08:19.84] little exercise for you
[08:20.96] so you gotta argue that
[08:24.08] this linear map
[08:27.76] 3 a b c d
[08:30.88] annihilates symmetric tenses
[08:40.56] in t02 okay that's an important little
[08:43.52] exercise for you to
[08:44.72] convince yourself that way
[08:47.92] we induce a linear map
[08:58.48] l going from w to w
[09:06.84] from
[09:11.32] rabcd
[09:14.48] where w is the space
[09:18.48] of two forms
[09:23.68] at this at the point at a point p so
[09:26.80] remember two forms are anti-symmetric
[09:28.96] tenses of type zero two
[09:33.44] and now uh this this linear map right
[09:36.00] we're moving we're mapping from
[09:37.68] uh now a real vector space to a real
[09:39.60] vector space we have a linear map
[09:41.36] and what kind of linear map is it well
[09:43.84] it turns out that it's a pretty nice
[09:45.12] linear map
[09:48.48] so the symmetric property of the riemann
[09:51.28] curvature tensor
[09:56.88] that you argued in as an exercise in a
[09:59.36] previous lecture
[10:00.24] so that you can swap these indices a b
[10:03.12] and c d
[10:03.76] as a pair
[10:07.84] this symmetry property implies
[10:12.16] that l is a symmetric matrix
[10:23.92] and further it's on an inner product
[10:30.84] space
[10:34.80] the inner product space is that of all
[10:36.96] uh is w the space of any symmetric
[10:39.36] two tenses uh type zero two tensors and
[10:42.56] what's the inner product well
[10:44.32] you know you've gotta distinguished
[10:46.40] inner product here
[10:47.44] uh furnished by
[10:50.88] ajb right the the tensor the
[10:54.56] metric on sigma t
[10:57.84] so we've got ourselves a a symmetric
[11:01.36] matrix acting on an inner product space
[11:03.60] and whenever you are fortunate enough to
[11:05.28] have
[11:06.00] a uh symmetric matrix or on an inner
[11:08.40] product space
[11:09.12] then you you know that the matrix is
[11:11.36] diagonal and it has real eigenvalues
[11:32.40] so the matrix l has real eigenvalues and
[11:35.36] eigenvectors so let's just diagonalize
[11:37.20] it
[11:39.36] well if we do that then we have a
[11:42.88] basis independent way of selecting a
[11:45.68] geometrically distinct two form at p
[11:48.80] if if if the eigenvalues are not
[11:51.60] degenerate
[11:52.64] so there's three
[11:56.24] eigenvalues
[12:00.72] i'm not much mistaken this is space of
[12:03.04] two forms
[12:04.00] has dimension
[12:11.28] three choose two
[12:14.72] which is three right yeah
[12:19.20] so this matrix l has three eigenvalues
[12:22.40] and three eigenvectors
[12:26.08] and the argument is that
[12:31.36] all eigenvalues of l
[12:36.64] are degenerate or equal
[12:39.68] let's just say cool is easy to write to
[12:42.40] all the imo's of l are equal
[12:44.48] now why is that well suppose they
[12:46.08] weren't equal that would mean
[12:47.60] that there was one eigenvalue one odd
[12:49.92] one out right
[12:50.72] and from that you would be able to
[12:53.20] select at every point p in the manifold
[12:55.28] a two form corresponding to this one odd
[12:58.32] one out
[12:59.60] and that two form would be a distinct
[13:02.40] distinguished two form chosen in a basis
[13:04.56] uh independent prescription and that
[13:07.76] would be a preferred
[13:09.36] 2 form at p but a 2 form
[13:12.72] can always be completed to a unique 3
[13:14.88] form up to a sign
[13:16.40] and that would therefore choose a
[13:17.92] preferred vector at p so that's why the
[13:19.92] eigenvalues
[13:21.68] are equal
[13:26.80] and i'll just summarize that discussion
[13:28.48] as otherwise we could
[13:31.20] construct our preferred
[13:35.84] vector
[13:41.44] at the point p and so we learned that l
[13:45.04] is proportional to the identity matrix
[13:47.20] the three by three identity matrix
[13:49.68] and this means that the
[13:53.12] riemann tensor r a b c d
[13:56.64] the with the appropriately raised
[14:00.96] indices it has the following form if you
[14:04.16] just
[14:06.00] work it out as an exercise what identity
[14:08.88] matrix must mean
[14:10.32] in terms of the components of the
[14:11.68] riemann tensor then this this
[14:14.40] formula here involving these delta
[14:15.92] functions
[14:20.24] and this k here is the constant of
[14:28.84] proportionality
[14:34.56] that constant and proportionality there
[14:40.56] and is it a constant well it really is a
[14:42.72] constant thanks to homogeneity
[15:01.92] but if you're not satisfied with that
[15:03.28] statement then let's just prove it
[15:04.96] uh independently
[15:10.48] obviously argue this
[15:20.96] so what we're going to do is we're going
[15:21.84] to lower the indices c and d
[15:30.80] and we will have the following
[15:34.96] three-dimensional riemann curvature
[15:36.72] tensor for sigma
[15:39.12] t
[15:42.48] and now we're going to uh infer
[15:45.68] that isotropy alone will
[15:49.68] ensure that k is a constant
[15:56.88] and the way we will do that is we'll
[15:58.08] look at the bianchi identity so
[16:06.32] the bianchi identity says that zero
[16:08.56] equals
[16:09.36] the covariant derivative of the three
[16:16.48] dimensional riemann curvature tensor
[16:21.04] which because of the form of
[16:24.64] the metric of the rerun curvature tens
[16:28.00] as a function of the metric and the fact
[16:29.36] that the covariant derivative associated
[16:32.00] to the metric
[16:35.20] when applied to the metric vanishes
[16:47.20] we learn that this
[16:50.72] bianchi identity is the same as just
[16:53.60] applying the covariance derivative to
[16:55.04] this
[16:56.00] this uh scalar k
[16:59.92] now if the dimension of the manifold is
[17:03.28] greater than or equal to three because
[17:04.80] if the dimensions two and one things are
[17:06.96] highly degenerate and you don't get any
[17:08.40] new information there
[17:10.08] then the fact that the right hand side
[17:11.84] of this equation vanishes
[17:13.68] well that tells us uh that can happen if
[17:16.88] and only if
[17:17.68] d e k is vanishing or in other words um
[17:22.32] k is constant on sigma t
[17:26.56] so we've learned something pretty pretty
[17:28.40] remarkable via this this
[17:30.24] sequence of um of steps
[17:34.40] you know we start by in building an
[17:36.00] induced riemann curvature tensor
[17:38.80] on this uh hypersurface sigma t
[17:42.40] we use isotropy to restrict the
[17:45.36] structure of this riemann curvature
[17:47.20] tensor
[17:48.56] and then we learn that that implies in
[17:52.88] turn
[17:53.36] that the riemann curvature tensor has a
[17:55.12] specific form in terms of the induced
[17:57.28] metric hab
[18:02.64] and that becomes a definition now
[18:22.88] so it's based on manifold where the
[18:25.28] curvature tensor has this very
[18:26.80] particular form that we've derived here
[18:28.88] as a consequence of isotropy and so on
[18:31.36] there's a
[18:32.08] consequence of isotropy as a name
[18:36.40] it's called uh with k constant
[18:44.24] it's called a space of constant
[18:45.60] curvature
[18:54.16] sort of not hard to imagine the the
[18:56.00] physics behind this definition
[18:58.00] you know whichever way you do your
[18:59.84] little remember the riemann curvature
[19:01.20] tensor tells you the failure of
[19:02.96] parallel transport operations to commute
[19:05.68] and it's saying no matter which way you
[19:07.12] do these little
[19:07.92] parallel transport operations you get
[19:09.92] the same failure to come
[19:11.20] to to commute so the curvature is
[19:14.16] constant in every direction
[19:22.84] curvature
[19:24.56] so now we've got this highly restrictive
[19:29.52] definition and consequence
[19:33.68] a highly restrictive
[19:37.44] structure of the riemann curvature so
[19:39.04] we're going to describe some
[19:40.32] representative space times that exhaust
[19:42.88] the possible options of the values of k
[20:02.32] you know we've said the riemann
[20:03.36] curvature tensor has to have this form
[20:05.60] now we're going to describe now a
[20:08.40] complete
[20:09.12] list of space times that exhibit this
[20:11.36] riemann curvature tensor
[20:18.56] and these will represent our
[20:23.28] hypotheses hypothesis models for
[20:26.88] homogeneous and isotropic space times
[20:32.32] all right we've got three cases to deal
[20:34.16] with firstly
[20:35.52] the case k is bigger than zero
[20:38.72] and this is achieved you can
[20:42.32] go ahead and calculate the riemann
[20:43.84] curvature tensor for this space time
[20:46.96] by sigma
[20:52.00] t being three spheres embedded in
[20:55.76] r four
[21:15.28] now remember this r4 is a fictitious r4
[21:18.40] the three spheres are considered as in
[21:22.48] intrinsic manifolds by themselves
[21:32.24] now this r here is the radius of this
[21:35.76] three sphere and the corresponding
[21:42.84] metric
[21:47.04] is described in spherical coordinates
[21:54.64] what is it well it's this is one
[21:57.20] representative
[21:58.00] way of writing a metric uh here we have
[22:00.88] the
[22:01.20] angle variables and radial variables is
[22:05.84] vanished because we're on the surface of
[22:07.44] the sphere
[22:12.80] so the case k bigger than zero positive
[22:15.92] curvature so to speak uh is that
[22:19.28] is achieved by three dimensional spheres
[22:22.00] and you can think of these three
[22:22.88] dimensional spheres
[22:24.16] explicitly as being embedded in r4 but
[22:26.72] this alpha has got nothing to do with
[22:28.32] the four dimensional space time that we
[22:29.76] live in it's just a way of
[22:31.12] describing these manifolds uh as
[22:33.36] embedded manifolds you must think of
[22:34.88] these three spheres as actually being
[22:36.88] intrinsically defined as
[22:38.24] three-dimensional manifolds
[22:40.08] and the metric is just the standard one
[22:42.48] in spherical coordinates
[22:44.24] now this this is an example uh
[22:49.52] this is called a closed universe
[23:01.36] this case where the manifold is this
[23:04.48] the spatial slices are close us three
[23:07.68] spheres because it's compact right
[23:10.40] everything's connected to everything
[23:11.68] there's no going off to infinity
[23:15.20] okay the case k equals naught well
[23:17.12] that's pretty easy right this is just
[23:18.72] flat 3d space
[23:25.52] and the metric is just that familiar d x
[23:28.16] squared plus d y
[23:29.28] squared plus d z squared this is
[23:32.64] called an open universe for
[23:39.84] i hope fairly obvious reasons
[23:42.96] all right uh well infinity is not
[23:45.12] explicitly included in this this
[23:46.96] this slice so you can go off to infinity
[23:50.16] in various directions we can also
[23:52.00] describe the metric using
[23:53.52] uh spherical coordinates um we may do
[23:56.40] that we in fact i think we do do that
[23:57.76] later on
[24:00.08] that's a nexus a little warm-up exercise
[24:02.00] view to remember how to express the
[24:03.68] metric of flats based on the spherical
[24:05.28] coordinates and the the somewhat
[24:07.12] interesting case
[24:07.92] also of there is a third case when
[24:09.92] there's negative curve
[24:11.68] what you might call negative curvature
[24:13.04] when k is less than equal to zero
[24:16.00] and that's obtained by hyperboloids
[24:35.28] so you can think of hyperboloids as
[24:36.80] being hypersurfaces
[24:38.56] in r4 embedded manifolds in r4
[24:45.04] with obeying this hyperbola equation
[24:48.40] here
[24:49.76] radius r and the metric
[24:59.28] in hyperbolic coordinates
[25:07.20] the metric reads d s squared equals
[25:10.40] d psi squared plus sinch squared
[25:14.16] psi d theta squared plus
[25:17.84] sine squared theta d phi squared
[25:21.68] and this is also an open universe
[25:36.80] now we've print we've presented a list
[25:40.64] of representative space times that
[25:42.72] exhaust all the possible
[25:44.96] values of k we can now
[25:48.80] take these spatial slice metrics and and
[25:52.00] uh
[25:52.48] embed them and use them to induce the
[25:55.84] full metric of space
[25:57.20] of four dimensional space-time
[26:00.48] and to do this we're going to exploit
[26:02.16] isotropy and homogeneity once again
[26:04.88] so the point being that as isotropic
[26:08.84] observers
[26:11.04] move on world lines
[26:16.32] orthogonal to sigma t
[26:25.44] we can express the metric the full
[26:29.04] 4d metric
[26:33.76] as follows
[26:49.28] so we've
[26:53.36] got
[26:56.40] an additional piece of data essentially
[26:58.40] that appears in the metric here
[27:02.64] you got to explain what that is or
[27:03.92] remind you what that is
[27:06.72] so here u a is the
[27:09.76] tangent vector
[27:15.76] for the isotropic observer
[27:21.28] all the observers right this field of
[27:23.28] isotropic observers
[27:25.12] and uh h-a-b-t
[27:29.04] is
[27:32.88] one of the metrics above
[27:49.04] now we can make things
[27:54.08] more consistent by uh the following
[27:57.04] observation
[27:59.20] so we note that all isotropic observers
[28:01.76] are going to
[28:02.32] assign the same proper time tau
[28:05.52] to the surface sigma t and so what we're
[28:08.72] going to do is
[28:10.24] express our metric
[28:13.84] in a coordinate system adapted to the
[28:16.40] proper tone
[28:44.96] so in the these coordinates
[28:52.00] our metric becomes the following
[28:59.28] we have the following metric d s squared
[29:01.68] is minus d
[29:03.04] tau squared right the constant in front
[29:04.96] of d tau is one that's the proper time
[29:07.44] plus there's a function a squared tau
[29:10.88] which is more or less the the the
[29:13.04] constant k
[29:14.80] and then you have three options right
[29:16.56] you have either
[29:18.24] closed three sphere
[29:28.24] you have flat three space
[29:38.48] or you have hyperboloid
[29:54.48] and this is called the friedmann
[30:00.30] [Music]
[30:06.84] lemaitre
[30:10.56] robertson
[30:15.60] walker metric
[30:19.84] or flrw metric
[30:37.20] and this is going to be our fundamental
[30:39.68] model
[30:40.24] for highly simplified of course for the
[30:43.44] universe
[30:44.16] in the next couple of lectures
[30:51.04] so what we've done is by assuming
[30:53.44] homogeneity
[30:54.48] and isotropy we've reduced the task
[30:58.32] of finding the metric
[31:01.44] of the of a universe of a highly
[31:04.40] symmetric
[31:05.04] version of our universe to the task of
[31:07.28] finding
[31:08.16] just one single scalar function a
[31:11.36] tao and that's a
[31:14.80] huge simplification
[31:22.64] we just need to solve
[31:26.96] for a tau just one single scalar
[31:29.68] function a of tau
[31:31.52] that's an extraordinary simplification
[31:33.92] and we hope
[31:35.20] sincerely and it is indeed a well
[31:37.84] justified hope that when we substitute
[31:39.44] this metric into einstein's field
[31:40.88] equations with the appropriate
[31:42.32] stress energy tensor on the right hand
[31:43.92] side that
[31:45.60] we'll be able to reduce all of the 16 or
[31:49.28] whatever 10 einstein field equations
[31:51.20] down to a single differential equation
[31:52.96] say for a of tau and that hope is
[31:54.88] realizable and we will be able to solve
[31:56.88] for a
[31:57.36] of tau and but that however will be the
[32:00.00] subject of the next lecture
[32:02.24] that's it for this lecture thank you
[32:04.40] very much and
[32:05.60] goodbye
