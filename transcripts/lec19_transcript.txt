[00:00.56] hello and welcome back to introduction
[00:02.24] to general relativity
[00:03.60] in the previous lecture we started
[00:05.52] looking at the
[00:06.80] solutions to einstein's field equations
[00:09.12] for a homogeneous and isotropic universe
[00:11.20] and in particular we discussed some
[00:13.84] qualitative aspects of the solutions
[00:15.84] that we could infer already on the basis
[00:17.84] of the general structure of the defining
[00:19.60] equations of motion
[00:21.04] in today's lecture we're going to solve
[00:22.72] the equations analytically
[00:24.56] and then uh portray and then discuss
[00:27.20] several aspects
[00:28.16] of these analytic solutions and finally
[00:31.52] at the last part of the lecture i'm
[00:32.80] going to introduce the topic
[00:34.96] of static rotationally symmetric space
[00:38.96] times
[00:41.60] okay just to remind you the equations
[00:44.32] governing the dynamics of a
[00:46.08] homogeneous isotopic universe are
[00:48.24] summarized here with equations one
[00:49.84] and two and these are
[00:53.04] a set of non-linear ordinary
[00:55.60] differential equations not
[00:56.96] partial differential equations anymore
[00:58.32] but ordinary differential equations
[01:00.40] and you can solve these in a variety of
[01:02.88] circumstances for a
[01:04.16] variety of values of k remember k is -1
[01:06.56] 0 or 1
[01:07.84] and rho and p can be variously positive
[01:10.88] or negative depending
[01:12.08] on the dark energy constant coming from
[01:14.88] the cosmological constant
[01:17.44] so we have a uh we can go ahead and
[01:20.32] solve these equations we can also use
[01:22.08] this
[01:22.48] additional equation that i
[01:25.52] summarized in the previous lecture so
[01:27.76] this equation you can
[01:29.20] derive by eliminating a from the
[01:32.56] a double dot from the previous two
[01:34.08] equations if you just eliminate a double
[01:36.08] dot you can actually
[01:37.36] arrive at this equation here and using
[01:39.92] this equation we can
[01:41.28] uh we can already infer
[01:44.48] a couple of statements about the
[01:47.28] evolution
[01:48.00] of the energy density and a
[01:53.60] so one of the we have to always consider
[01:56.32] that there's several
[01:57.28] models that we could uh contemplate one
[02:00.40] is for example the universe comprised of
[02:02.08] dust which is like these idealized dots
[02:04.16] that come from
[02:04.88] galaxies and in such a dust-like
[02:08.72] uh distribution of matter
[02:12.56] we can that's where the the pressure
[02:15.20] term is zero
[02:16.40] so the dots are moving the little point
[02:18.48] particles representing galaxies move on
[02:20.24] on the geodesics of isotropic observers
[02:22.72] then this equation simplifies slightly i
[02:24.80] mean
[02:25.12] a little bit right and uh
[02:29.04] and we can realize that that's actually
[02:31.36] just a total derivative
[02:33.04] you know in disguise so this is really
[02:35.92] easy to then integrate so it's actually
[02:37.52] a total derivative of the function
[02:39.12] rho a cubed equals zero which tells us
[02:42.48] of course
[02:43.28] that in any such dust like universe that
[02:46.48] rho
[02:46.88] times a cubed is a constant
[02:50.72] and that's good that's actually really a
[02:53.36] sanity check on
[02:54.48] on the equation because what does it
[02:56.00] tell us it tells us that
[02:57.84] uh that this is just a conservation law
[03:01.84] right in disguise
[03:04.88] it's the conservation of rest mass of
[03:07.52] the dust
[03:08.56] because a determines the volume of the
[03:10.88] universe and
[03:11.76] grow the energy density so you better
[03:14.56] not have that
[03:15.92] uh rest mass has been created or
[03:17.52] destroyed here and that's
[03:19.36] that that's this uh solution tells us
[03:22.24] exactly that
[03:24.80] now that's just for the dust light
[03:26.08] universe but there is another
[03:27.84] scenario that we can contemplate i mean
[03:29.76] there's many scenarios to contemplate
[03:31.76] but let's consider now uh the the
[03:34.72] radiation
[03:35.60] dominated uh situation
[03:42.48] where rho equals
[03:46.16] p over three
[03:50.48] and in this case
[03:53.52] we find by a very similar argument that
[03:55.60] rho times a to the four
[03:58.96] is a constant
[04:03.60] it's just a total derivative argument
[04:05.04] again um and this looks a different a
[04:07.20] little different to the dust case you
[04:08.48] know is there a conservation of breast
[04:09.84] mass going on here well
[04:11.44] uh not quite right because there is no
[04:13.12] wrist mass for a photon
[04:16.72] i mean you can't stop a photon but of
[04:19.04] course there's energy
[04:20.48] associated to a photon and so here what
[04:23.52] interprets
[04:27.52] the result as follows
[04:33.12] so the photon number
[04:40.64] the photon number density right you said
[04:42.32] the num the number of modes
[04:45.44] photonic modes you have in a volume well
[04:48.48] that scales
[04:49.52] uh as the inverse of the volume right
[04:53.60] as a to the minus three and as the
[04:56.96] universe
[04:57.76] is expanding or whatever contracting
[05:01.44] uh it's getting also however
[05:05.28] there's a frequency component to the
[05:06.80] photons energy and
[05:09.52] the point is the the photonic mode is
[05:12.48] getting stretched or contracted as the
[05:14.32] universe is changing
[05:15.84] and that actually contributes an
[05:17.28] additional redshift a to the minus
[05:19.20] one so the hence the radiation
[05:26.40] uh hence we obtained this slightly
[05:28.88] adjusted
[05:29.60] conservation of drawn above here that
[05:31.28] the rho times a to the four is a
[05:32.96] constant not times row times 83 and
[05:34.64] that's really due to the redshift of the
[05:36.84] photon
[05:38.08] and now that tells us actually something
[05:40.16] quite kind of interesting right
[05:42.40] uh namely that dust doesn't dominate the
[05:45.68] evolution of the universe in the past
[05:47.28] rather radiation does
[05:54.56] so as we you know in the past of our
[05:56.32] universe a went to zero
[05:58.00] well that diverges quicker rho times a
[06:00.32] to the four diverges quicker than rho
[06:02.08] times a to the three so the contribution
[06:04.64] or the contribution due to the radiation
[06:07.20] actually dominates
[06:09.12] in the past or dominated in the past
[06:19.52] so let's just now specialize this is a
[06:22.00] statement that's independent of k
[06:23.84] if you take a look at the equation we
[06:25.84] were solving and
[06:27.52] the solution k didn't feature in it but
[06:29.68] of course k has got a feature somehow
[06:32.64] whether or not the universe is
[06:33.68] hyperboloid spherical or
[06:36.16] spatially flat is going to play a role
[06:39.04] uh and now we have to make a bit of a
[06:40.88] finer case
[06:41.92] distinction
[06:45.92] so if k equals 0 or
[06:49.92] k equals minus 1
[06:57.44] then and further we assume
[07:01.44] the now we continue to assume that rho
[07:05.76] and p
[07:06.32] are greater than zero then we we learn
[07:09.36] that that a
[07:10.00] is a dot is zero
[07:14.48] and the fact that the universe is
[07:15.60] therefore what do we learn well we
[07:17.12] learned that internal
[07:18.64] that we were in a state of eternal
[07:20.32] expansion because expansion
[07:22.16] of the universe has been established
[07:24.00] right today we have expansion
[07:36.96] and if you observe that you have
[07:38.72] expansion that naming that a dot is
[07:40.24] greater than naught
[07:41.20] and you're in the k equals minus one
[07:42.64] scenario then on the right hand side of
[07:44.16] this equation one here you have only
[07:45.44] positive stuff so the the derivative in
[07:47.44] a
[07:47.92] can never go to zero
[07:52.72] in that scenario when k is either flat
[07:55.28] uh representing the flat
[07:56.48] spatial slices or k is representing
[08:00.16] hyperbolic
[08:01.28] space like as spatial slices
[08:07.04] further rho must decrease
[08:17.60] as a increases
[08:31.52] thus rho times a squared tends to zero
[08:34.32] as a tends infinity
[08:41.60] now for k equals 0
[08:44.72] this expansion velocity so a dot
[08:46.96] represents essentially the
[08:48.16] velocity of expansion a dot that tends
[08:54.80] to zero
[08:55.36] as tau tends to infinity
[08:58.72] but for k equals minus one
[09:02.96] a dot tends to one as del tends to
[09:06.84] infinity
[09:08.80] and finally we can talk about the k
[09:10.48] equals plus one case for k equals plus
[09:12.88] one
[09:17.12] we actually have another situation where
[09:19.76] k equals plus one
[09:21.44] then this negative term here can take
[09:23.12] over in the right hand side to one
[09:28.08] and it we can infer that the universe
[09:31.04] ends
[09:32.72] in the opposite of a big bang which
[09:34.48] would be a big crunch
[09:40.72] okay this is still at a qualitative
[09:42.16] level now let's just
[09:44.56] get the exact solutions
[10:02.56] and all now describe how you can
[10:05.68] obtain these exact solutions
[10:09.04] in the case of say a dust dominated
[10:12.00] universe
[10:17.04] and then you'll be able to infer how one
[10:20.64] can get the
[10:21.36] solutions for other situations
[10:26.96] now you can rearrange equation one
[10:30.00] to look like this
[10:35.28] where c equals 8 pi rho a cubed
[10:40.80] divided by 3 is a constant right the c
[10:43.76] really here is a constant
[10:45.12] this is meant to be big c because rho
[10:48.08] times a cubed in a dust dominated
[10:49.92] universe is a constant
[10:53.76] and similarly for radiation
[10:57.52] dominated or a universe with only
[11:00.24] radiation
[11:02.48] type
[11:05.60] radiation content then you also have a
[11:08.16] similar equation but with an a squared
[11:09.84] there
[11:13.04] where the constant c prime is now 8 pi
[11:15.52] rho a to the 4 remember rho times a to
[11:17.60] the 4 is a constant
[11:19.68] now this is a nonlinear differential
[11:22.88] equation now
[11:24.24] in a and you can
[11:27.44] solve it by standard techniques right
[11:30.72] this is you work out what the derivative
[11:33.04] of a is and then it's an integral and
[11:35.04] then you work out the integral and the
[11:36.60] constants um
[11:43.60] this is you can do it
[11:48.80] but i'm not going to do it here because
[11:50.32] this is this is sort of something that
[11:51.68] you might encounter already in a
[11:53.12] non-linear differential equations course
[11:55.12] i won't say that it's super trivial like
[11:57.28] the integrals are
[11:58.32] so mildly mildly irritating that you
[12:01.20] have to do
[12:02.64] and the answers
[12:07.68] that you get
[12:12.80] have a bunch of constants that are
[12:14.16] buried implicitly in them and it's a bit
[12:16.40] can be a bit awkward to extract
[12:20.24] this information from
[12:23.36] the solutions that you find
[12:26.72] but it's not
[12:29.92] you know there's no sort of fundamental
[12:31.68] physical reasons for things being
[12:35.92] difficult it's just slightly awkward on
[12:37.84] a mathematical level
[12:42.96] so this eta is a constant of integration
[12:45.76] that appears
[12:50.96] when you when you integrate these
[13:04.84] equations
[13:44.72] so the case of k0 is somewhat simpler to
[13:47.60] derive
[13:49.60] there's a little symbol on my notes that
[13:52.00] i cannot read for the moment
[13:53.76] i will just
[13:59.52] look up the correct answer so i don't
[14:01.52] write down the wrong thing there
[14:08.80] okay this is nine c
[14:11.92] over four so the flat case is pretty
[14:14.40] easy to integrate actually
[14:15.60] you won't have any trouble there the
[14:17.20] only difficult ones are the spherical
[14:18.72] ones
[14:19.12] and the hyperbolic ones
[14:24.48] but once you've done the spherical one
[14:25.76] the hyperbolic one no longer becomes a
[14:28.84] challenge
[14:30.80] and then you should hopefully confirm
[14:36.72] these
[14:40.16] solutions for a prime
[14:52.32] prime of course
[15:02.48] and you should come arrive at a table
[15:04.32] that looks kind of like this one
[15:06.64] up to the labeling of your constants
[15:10.40] so these this is this is an enumeration
[15:12.80] a case distinction of all the possible
[15:14.48] choices of k
[15:15.44] and whether or not you have a dust
[15:16.88] dominated or radiation dominated
[15:19.60] energy stress energy content of the
[15:22.00] universe
[15:25.04] now these solutions have a name uh well
[15:28.72] the spherical solution
[15:33.52] or indeed
[15:39.12] sometimes all
[15:44.16] are called
[15:50.40] the friedman the metro robertson walker
[15:54.32] cosmology
[16:07.04] and i'll just briefly sketch
[16:10.16] the solutions
[16:15.44] for the various cases so one is this one
[16:17.84] that ends in the big crunch that's k
[16:19.20] equals plus one
[16:20.88] one of them is the k
[16:23.92] equals zero and one of them turns off to
[16:26.40] k equals
[16:29.28] it tends off to one and it turns off the
[16:31.36] tower and that's the
[16:32.40] k equals minus one solution
[16:35.44] so that pretty much concludes the
[16:37.84] discussion
[16:38.96] of cosmology for this course i mean this
[16:42.16] is just
[16:42.96] so much more that you could say
[16:46.00] about cosmology and solutions to
[16:48.64] einstein's equations and shaft field
[16:50.32] equations
[16:52.24] in describing universes homogeneous and
[16:55.04] isotropic universes
[16:56.56] we won't consider these topics any
[16:58.48] further in this course but rather you
[17:00.16] can use this discussion as a springboard
[17:01.84] into
[17:02.56] reading the more advanced literature on
[17:04.32] this topic
[17:05.76] instead i want to take out discussion
[17:07.60] now
[17:11.36] to the other celebrated
[17:14.56] solution of einstein's field equations
[17:18.72] so it's really roughly speaking there's
[17:20.80] two two major well-known solutions to
[17:22.96] electron field equations one is this
[17:24.40] flrw solution
[17:26.16] and the other is the schwarzschild
[17:27.52] solution which pertains to
[17:29.60] static solutions nothing changes in time
[17:32.88] of rotationally invariant distributions
[17:36.08] of matter or
[17:40.48] or the gravitational field generated by
[17:42.48] a spherical
[17:44.16] symmetric body
[17:50.00] and in order to to write down the
[17:52.56] solution
[17:53.20] i'm going to spend the rest of this
[17:55.36] lecture talking about
[17:56.96] what it could mean for a stationary
[17:59.60] first base zone to be stationary and
[18:01.04] what it can mean for a space time to be
[18:03.12] rotationally invariant this is uh this
[18:06.08] discussion will be posed at a level
[18:08.00] of intermediate rigor what do i mean so
[18:11.04] we'll try and make uh clean definitions
[18:14.80] uh but i'm not gonna bother proving
[18:16.40] things too too much
[18:18.24] and because in the end this discussion
[18:19.92] is a motivation for a
[18:21.52] uh hypothesis for a metric so in the end
[18:24.16] we're just gonna write down a metric
[18:25.92] and the metric uh will then be the basis
[18:29.20] as an unzips for a solution to
[18:31.68] einstein's field equations and at that
[18:33.28] point
[18:33.76] who cares where uh how we got to it uh
[18:37.20] the metric either solves einstein's
[18:38.72] field equations or not
[18:40.48] um and hence the slightly advanced
[18:43.20] mathematical
[18:44.32] uh preliminary discussion required to
[18:46.32] sort of derive this form of the metric
[18:48.72] um isn't so important i mean the the end
[18:51.12] here is the objective namely does this
[18:52.72] metric solve einstein's field equations
[18:54.24] and if so
[18:55.68] what can we learn from that how we got
[18:58.16] to that guess that simplified form of
[18:59.92] the metric
[19:00.48] is helpful for you to know but it isn't
[19:02.88] critical right
[19:03.76] it's it's sufficient to remember the
[19:06.00] form of the metric but how did we get
[19:07.68] there well i'll give you some
[19:10.16] a i'll give you some
[19:14.72] motivation for this metric which is
[19:16.96] based on rigorous mathematics
[19:20.72] and firstly well if we're gonna do
[19:23.36] something rigorous we need some
[19:24.24] definitions
[19:25.04] so we gotta explore what is meant by the
[19:28.40] word stationary and static
[19:33.36] so we're interested in a stationary uh
[19:35.52] indeed a static solution to ionize field
[19:37.36] equation is one that doesn't change in
[19:50.84] time
[20:00.56] and here is the first definition that we
[20:03.12] can exploit
[20:03.84] to capture this concept
[20:14.88] so this is a perfectly rigorous
[20:16.48] definition now a space time m is a
[20:18.40] stationary
[20:19.36] if there is exists a one parameter group
[20:22.16] phi t
[20:22.80] of isometries whose orbits are time like
[20:26.00] curves
[20:26.96] and these are somehow the time
[20:28.16] translates
[20:30.96] so that's what it means for a space time
[20:32.40] to be stationary
[20:35.68] there's an equivalent formulation
[20:44.64] if there exists
[20:50.40] the time like
[20:54.40] killing vector field
[21:01.52] that's a different way to say it right
[21:05.20] now stationary is not static
[21:27.92] so space time
[21:32.48] m is static
[21:38.00] if it is stationary
[21:47.36] and
[21:50.72] there exists
[21:55.04] now some additional structure namely a
[21:57.12] space like hypersurface
[22:05.44] which is orthogonal
[22:14.56] to the orbits of uh this isometry group
[22:19.84] now this is a little bit uh more subtle
[22:24.24] the consequences of this definition and
[22:26.72] this is where i am gonna
[22:28.56] skip some of the the mathematical
[22:32.64] discussion but i will say it here
[22:36.24] in case you want to chase this up on
[22:37.84] your own
[22:40.00] so fabinho's theorem on integrability
[22:46.48] tells us this is equivalent to requiring
[22:53.12] that this time like killing vector field
[22:56.32] x i a
[23:05.68] additionally satisfies
[23:11.04] this equation here
[23:14.72] this has got to do with the community
[23:20.84] commuting
[23:22.88] with parallel transports
[23:31.76] and uh we're not going to prove this
[23:34.84] here
[23:43.20] because as i said earlier it is just
[23:48.84] motivation
[23:54.80] so there are examples of space times
[23:57.76] that aren't stationary
[23:58.96] so this is space time there isn't uh
[24:02.72] not a uh one parameter group of
[24:05.44] isometries whose orbits are time-like
[24:07.28] curves this it is
[24:08.56] counter example and there are space
[24:11.76] terms that are stationary and not static
[24:15.52] so in coordinates let's just illustrate
[24:30.84] now
[24:34.16] just trying now illustrate the this
[24:37.44] these definitions and what it means in
[24:40.24] coordinates
[24:41.92] so i'm going to draw
[24:45.12] big sigma
[24:52.16] and big sigma is this
[24:55.68] hyper surface
[24:59.12] and on big sigma you've got you can
[25:02.64] look at this time like killing vector
[25:04.56] field on big sigma
[25:05.84] here it is x i a a bunch of vectors
[25:11.20] on big sigma
[25:14.32] and these vectors
[25:18.08] are all orthogonal in a static
[25:21.60] universe to this hypersurface sigma and
[25:28.40] in
[25:31.60] and this will allow us actually to
[25:33.92] construct
[25:35.04] a uh foliation of our
[25:40.84] space-time
[25:44.56] so if sigma x i a is not zero
[25:48.00] on sigma of course it could be zero
[25:49.84] right that would also be orthogonal
[25:52.16] uh so we have to additionally assume
[25:54.32] that x i
[25:55.36] is not zero then what we can do is
[25:59.60] we can build a neighborhood
[26:04.16] around the hypersurface
[26:08.16] i'll call the neighborhood n and i'll
[26:11.28] draw it now
[26:17.68] so the neighborhood is
[26:21.76] like this little little chunk of space
[26:24.16] time around
[26:28.24] the hyperservice sigma
[26:36.80] and then we'll also be able
[26:40.64] to introduce other hypersurfaces related
[26:43.60] to sigma by
[26:44.48] translating the whole hypersurface along
[26:47.20] the geodesics
[26:49.28] generated by psi a so anyway to begin
[26:52.80] with we've got this neighborhood n
[26:54.08] and is this orange some parallel pivot
[26:57.52] like thing
[27:04.64] so as long as psi a is not zero then
[27:06.40] every point of our hyperservice sigma
[27:10.32] will lie on a unique orbit
[27:27.60] so now we're going to choose some
[27:32.84] coordinates
[27:37.92] on our hyper surface and we're going to
[27:39.36] extend these to a coordinate system of
[27:40.80] that whole space time
[27:45.12] so we're going to label
[27:48.64] each point p in this neighborhood
[27:52.24] and this fattened thickened version of
[27:55.68] the hypersurface
[28:02.80] by the parameter t
[28:05.92] of the orbit
[28:10.80] reaching p and the coordinates
[28:18.40] x mu of the point
[28:23.44] in sigma connected
[28:28.80] to p
[28:34.56] so we've coordinatized this patterned or
[28:36.80] thickened piece
[28:38.08] of our space time
[28:45.52] but we can do we can infer slightly more
[28:48.16] because
[28:48.72] this coordinate system isn't generated
[28:50.56] by just any old vector field
[28:52.80] it's generated by a killing vector field
[28:59.36] which means it's generated by an
[29:00.72] isometry
[29:11.60] and that means that the metric if you if
[29:13.52] you choose to express your metric
[29:15.52] in this coordinate system then the
[29:17.92] metric components
[29:28.00] in the system are independent
[29:32.56] of t
[29:41.60] and as sigma t which is
[29:45.12] the set of
[29:50.00] points
[29:53.36] reached by five t
[29:56.56] from sigma so i'm going to draw sigma t
[29:58.56] now sigma t is like a another hyper
[30:00.48] surface right
[30:06.48] every point in sigma t is just the image
[30:09.04] of sigma
[30:09.92] under phi of t
[30:17.84] all right as this is an image of a bunch
[30:20.80] of points under an isometry
[30:23.52] we learn that sigma t is also orthogonal
[30:30.24] to the vector field the killing vector
[30:32.24] field
[30:35.28] uh xi8
[30:44.64] or orthogonal to the orbits
[30:50.32] of phi of t to make it
[30:54.88] to use a language that's consistent with
[30:56.64] the definition of static
[30:59.12] and uh in these coordinates now we can
[31:02.80] actually infer a bit of a simplification
[31:04.88] for the metric
[31:12.64] the metric takes a very particular form
[31:18.96] namely d s squared is
[31:22.08] minus v squared something that depends
[31:24.32] on the coordinates of the hypersurface
[31:26.24] but not time
[31:29.12] plus some spatial stuff which is
[31:32.40] decoupled
[31:33.84] there's no space time components
[31:46.40] and what is v the scalar factor well
[31:48.56] it's got to be the length of the
[31:51.92] killing vector field
[31:55.44] so we've already thrown out we got we
[31:57.12] got time time components we've got space
[31:58.96] based components but we have no space
[32:00.40] time components now
[32:01.60] thanks for a static
[32:04.72] metric it's already a simplification
[32:08.08] right instead of looking for
[32:09.84] 10 things we're now looking for
[32:13.68] seven things i think right three five
[32:16.48] six
[32:16.80] seven seven functions
[32:20.72] so seven is fewer than ten but still not
[32:23.28] like
[32:24.24] still quite a lot of things but we
[32:25.92] haven't exploited the fact that we're
[32:27.12] looking for
[32:28.24] something that's spherically symmetric
[32:32.48] this is just static the metric that i've
[32:35.12] just written down here metric star
[32:38.64] let's now take a look and see if we can
[32:41.20] use spherical
[32:42.00] symmetry to further simplify the form of
[32:45.60] the metric
[32:48.88] now what does it mean spherical symmetry
[32:50.96] well again
[32:52.48] you know you look to the symmetries
[32:53.92] right the word symmetry tells you
[32:55.28] everything
[33:02.56] and in particular
[33:05.60] for something to be spherically
[33:06.88] symmetric it must mean that of all the
[33:08.64] symmetries that your manifold
[33:10.08] has
[33:13.20] there must be a subgroup that's
[33:15.20] equivalent to the symmetries of a sphere
[33:18.40] so a space-time atmospherically
[33:20.00] symmetric
[33:22.88] if it's isometry group right that's the
[33:24.80] group of all its symmetries
[33:30.32] it contains a subgroup
[33:33.36] so there must be a bunch of sub of sub
[33:35.36] symmetries
[33:36.80] uh which are equivalent to those of the
[33:39.68] sphere
[33:43.12] and the symmetries of the sphere is the
[33:44.64] lead group so3
[33:46.16] the rotations
[33:51.44] and well you there's a kind of
[33:53.04] degenerate way
[33:54.56] where that could be the case and so we
[33:57.12] want to prevent that
[33:58.40] um namely your space-time might be just
[34:01.04] a point
[34:02.24] right that that the isometry group sort
[34:04.96] of degenerately contains a
[34:06.48] representation
[34:07.52] it contains a subgroup isomorphic so3
[34:11.20] uh so we want to somehow prevent such
[34:15.12] weird degenerate situations
[34:17.84] so we say that the orbits
[34:21.84] of the subgroup these form got to form
[34:24.16] sub-manifolds
[34:25.52] and those sub-manifolds better be
[34:29.12] if you morph it to s2
[34:36.24] the surface of the sphere
[34:40.72] and now let's let's try and deduce some
[34:43.60] um
[34:44.72] consequences of this definition well the
[34:47.84] first is
[34:48.48] that the full space time metric
[34:54.64] g a b the full metric whatever it is
[34:58.72] because these s2s these surfaces of the
[35:01.12] sphere these orbits of the this
[35:02.96] isometric group are sub manifolds now
[35:07.36] they this metric induces
[35:10.80] a metric on each orbit
[35:18.88] and because of the so3 symmetry because
[35:21.36] of this rotation invariance
[35:25.84] because these isometries
[35:31.20] this induced metric
[35:35.52] we'll call it habit
[35:45.44] because the full spacetime metric is
[35:48.08] invariant under
[35:49.12] these rotations we must have that the
[35:50.88] induced metric
[35:52.64] is a multiple
[36:04.40] of the metric of a two-sphere
[36:18.32] right because there's no other way to
[36:20.16] have a so
[36:22.48] three invariant metric that induces
[36:26.00] a metric on the sphere there's no other
[36:29.84] possible metric you can write on the
[36:31.20] two-sphere
[36:39.76] that's invariant other rotations
[36:49.12] and we could what is this constant
[36:52.16] of proportionality we could label it by
[36:54.08] the area of the orbit sphere itself
[37:05.84] so we can introduce some notation we
[37:07.52] could you know once we've labeled our
[37:10.00] uh uh our metrics on all these induced
[37:13.36] orbits we could
[37:14.56] label them instead by a radii like
[37:17.60] coordinate which is
[37:21.12] given by interpreting a literally as the
[37:23.36] area of the orbit
[37:25.12] sphere
[37:29.36] and then we can introduce coordinates
[37:33.36] on each of these orbit spheres
[37:56.88] you know we just use the the metric of
[37:58.80] this the two sphere which is unique
[38:01.28] the rotation invariant
[38:06.56] and now we know that the or the metric
[38:09.20] hab
[38:09.84] induced on each orbit sphere must look
[38:11.52] like this
[38:13.52] so the picture you should have in mind
[38:14.72] as you know here is a constant time
[38:16.32] slice here
[38:21.84] take a point p and
[38:25.04] act on it with all the
[38:28.56] rotations that
[38:32.88] come from the subgroup isomorphic so3
[38:35.44] and then you draw yourself an so
[38:38.16] at a sphere s2
[38:47.52] and now we have a sphere we got a uh
[38:50.88] we can choose a coordinate system uh
[38:56.32] just spherical coordinates on this
[38:58.84] sphere
[39:06.64] now this is in the case where the
[39:07.76] spacetime is just rotationally invariant
[39:09.36] but not necessarily static
[39:11.36] but now we can put all this together now
[39:13.44] so if this space time is
[39:15.28] static as well
[39:24.96] and we have to assume that the time like
[39:28.24] killing vector field site a
[39:31.36] is unique
[39:39.28] then this time like
[39:42.64] killing vector field is orthogonal to
[39:44.64] the
[39:47.68] orbit spheres
[39:51.76] and by the way i should have said you
[39:52.88] know you pick one point you you you
[39:54.64] apply the the isometry group to draw out
[39:56.72] a sphere s2
[39:57.84] now pick another point that's not on the
[39:59.28] sphere and say inside and then you draw
[40:01.76] well another sphere right
[40:04.88] and you can see how by repeating this
[40:06.80] process for all points
[40:10.00] on a constant time slice you foliate
[40:12.32] your constant time
[40:13.44] slice with spheres
[40:26.08] so the science must be uh in the case x
[40:29.44] i is unique
[40:30.24] then these cells are orthogonal to the
[40:32.24] the orbit spheres
[40:33.60] and why is that well if you project
[40:37.68] psi onto one of these orbit spheres
[40:41.68] and then uh this has to be invariant
[40:45.20] but the only invariant the only vector
[40:47.12] field invariant on the sphere
[40:50.64] is that the zero vector field so that's
[40:52.88] why x i a is orthogonal to the orbit
[40:54.96] spheres
[40:58.24] and um thus
[41:01.76] the orbit spheres
[41:05.44] actually lie in
[41:09.28] sigma t right
[41:12.96] which is orthogonal to the x is
[41:16.48] well now let's put all of this together
[41:18.16] into a to build a coordinate system
[41:26.72] and hence write out the metric that
[41:28.64] we're going to use as our
[41:30.72] unzips to solve einstein's field
[41:32.40] equations this is all this discussion
[41:34.32] today has all been just motivation
[41:36.48] for a particular choice of metric
[41:40.40] so we start by choosing a fiducial
[41:41.84] sphere just pick your favorite sphere
[41:44.08] in the hypersurface sigma
[41:48.16] and you know choose spherical
[41:51.04] coordinates on it
[42:04.48] and now we're going to propagate this
[42:06.56] coordinate system out
[42:07.84] to the the whole entirety of sigma
[42:13.76] just as we did for homogeneous and
[42:15.20] isotropic uh space times
[42:17.44] we're going to take geodesics
[42:21.44] orthogonal
[42:24.56] to the sphere to to build a full
[42:26.80] coordinate system
[42:27.84] of the or to carry out these coordinates
[42:31.12] outwards
[42:37.68] to other spheres
[42:44.48] and so the geodesic parameter
[42:48.00] that carries these coordinates outwards
[42:49.68] we could call it r the radius
[42:58.64] and so we've coordinated sigma t
[43:03.36] and now
[43:06.40] combining the coordinate system we have
[43:11.44] when we described the static universe
[43:14.56] so we we have the static universe and
[43:18.00] the metric text is very particular form
[43:19.52] here star
[43:20.64] so combining that
[43:24.96] with this new coordinate system we're
[43:26.72] building here
[43:36.80] we're going to combine this to build
[43:38.84] coordinates
[43:41.92] on our full space time
[43:47.28] labeled by t r theta and phi and in
[43:54.40] these
[43:55.44] coordinates
[44:01.04] our metric becomes the following
[44:12.08] there's the temporal component which has
[44:13.76] a it depends on the radius
[44:18.32] and here comes the spatial component
[44:19.84] which has now been highly constrained
[44:23.68] due to rotational variance to be
[44:26.40] effectively just
[44:27.36] the metric of
[44:30.64] the standard sphere and that
[44:33.68] concludes our discussion of static
[44:37.36] spherically symmetric space times
[44:42.96] if you like you can summarize this
[44:45.44] lecture as saying
[44:46.80] we hereby assume that the metric has
[44:48.56] this form
[44:50.56] written there the goal
[44:53.76] in the coming lectures
[44:57.28] is to substitute this formula metric
[44:59.04] into the vacuum einstein's field
[45:00.24] equations
[45:02.88] and to solve for these functions
[45:07.84] f and h that's
[45:11.20] the only degree of freedom left over in
[45:13.36] this metric
[45:14.64] and that's the task which we'll turn
[45:18.00] to in the next lecture but that's it for
[45:20.00] today
[45:21.04] thank you very much and see you next
[45:22.48] time goodbye
