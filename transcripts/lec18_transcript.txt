[00:00.00] hello and welcome back to introduction
[00:01.60] to general relativity in the previous
[00:03.44] lecture
[00:03.92] we started modeling the universe with
[00:05.84] einstein's general theory of relativity
[00:08.72] with some after some symmetry arguments
[00:10.80] we arrived at the following form
[00:12.80] of a highly idealized metric for the
[00:15.52] universe
[00:17.60] the goal of today's lecture is to
[00:21.04] derive all the geometric quantities we
[00:22.88] need to
[00:24.72] solve einstein's field equation and then
[00:26.64] solve our transfer equation for this
[00:28.16] particular form
[00:29.12] of the metric this flrw form
[00:33.68] so this is the flrw metric
[00:37.92] and our goal is to derive from the
[00:40.80] metric today everything we need
[00:42.88] to solve einstein's field equations so
[00:44.72] what does that mean that means the
[00:46.56] riemann tensor richie scala richie tensa
[00:50.96] and we'll also need to talk about the
[00:52.56] stress energy tensor as well
[00:56.48] so given this metric it's a uh
[01:00.64] exercise for you
[01:09.20] wait on how about i do the flat case
[01:11.04] first and then the non-flat cased
[01:15.28] so it's an exercise for you
[01:18.48] to show the following
[01:23.84] crystal symbols so first we'll deal with
[01:26.56] the case k equals zero that's the one
[01:27.92] that corresponds to minkowski space
[01:30.64] well not minkowski sorry um uh uh
[01:35.92] flat space like the time-like slices
[01:41.36] so the case k equals naught so in that
[01:43.60] case we could write the uh
[01:45.52] the metric as well basically a rescale
[01:50.24] normal lorentz metric
[01:55.12] we just go back to cartesian style
[01:56.88] coordinates for this um
[01:58.72] euclidean slice coordinate system
[02:02.48] and then he in this in this coordinate
[02:05.76] system the
[02:06.56] non-vanishing christopher symbols
[02:11.44] you can work them out pretty easily
[02:19.92] so this is an exercise although honestly
[02:22.08] it's not that difficult to exercise
[02:24.16] so here's the i'm only going to write
[02:26.64] down the crystal symbols that don't
[02:28.24] vanish
[02:33.76] and all the rest actually vanish so here
[02:37.20] a with a dot over it means the
[02:39.28] derivative with respect to tau
[02:41.52] proper time
[03:00.72] and you have a whole bunch of other
[03:02.48] crystal symbols that are non-vanishing
[03:05.20] but they're all very symmetric on
[03:06.80] account of the fact that the metric
[03:08.16] itself
[03:08.72] is rather symmetric so this
[03:12.48] thousand z's look very close to each
[03:15.28] other here
[03:19.68] okay and from that you can go ahead and
[03:21.76] work out the riemann tensor and the
[03:23.60] the uh richie scala and
[03:26.64] rigid tensor we're not going to focus so
[03:30.08] much on
[03:30.80] this this euclidean
[03:34.64] sliced coordinate system so much in fact
[03:37.92] i want to express everything in as
[03:40.40] general way as possible
[03:42.00] that can capture the basic elements of
[03:44.80] the universe we live in
[03:47.44] so now in in for that purpose we need to
[03:50.40] look at the k is not equal zero case
[03:57.60] and in this case you need to
[04:02.40] you can derive the crystal symbols again
[04:04.64] but we're going to use this
[04:06.08] spherical coordinate system to derive
[04:07.92] the crystal symbols in this case
[04:09.92] and we'll have the following rather long
[04:12.24] list of christopher symbols
[04:21.84] i mean any individual chris double
[04:23.44] symbol here isn't that difficult to
[04:26.84] derive
[04:28.80] probably the biggest challenge you're
[04:30.08] going to face in doing this calculation
[04:34.48] is uh ensuring that you know the
[04:37.12] inevitable mistakes that that creep in
[04:40.00] that you detect them quick enough
[04:48.08] having said that i may have made
[04:49.52] mistakes as well
[04:52.72] although i have checked these results
[04:56.40] nevertheless i may make transcription
[04:58.08] errors
[05:01.20] so it's important to not entirely trust
[05:05.52] what i write here
[05:08.88] so you get this long list of crystal
[05:10.88] symbols like this
[05:13.12] i've checked i admit i've checked a
[05:14.80] couple in mathematica
[05:23.44] and indeed although i do believe it's
[05:26.32] important to be able to do these kind of
[05:27.84] calculations yourself there reaches a
[05:29.52] point where
[05:32.16] something like mathematica is really a
[05:35.36] first-class tool to
[05:38.72] prevent mistakes
[05:48.56] okay we're almost through here
[06:08.16] and we're down to the last two crystal
[06:10.00] symbols now
[06:17.52] all right so when we're given the metric
[06:20.56] here this f l r w metric with this
[06:22.72] particular coordinate system with
[06:24.32] spherical
[06:25.28] type coordinates and we have this
[06:28.48] parameter k
[06:29.52] oops i didn't i forgot to remind you
[06:31.20] about k k equals minus 1
[06:34.16] that's the hyperboloid case
[06:38.72] k equals 0 is the flat case
[06:42.16] a flat spatial case
[06:46.84] oops
[06:50.24] and uh k equals plus one is the
[06:52.72] spherical case
[06:55.44] so you have three uh three
[06:56.88] representative metrics to capture the
[06:58.56] three kinds of space time
[07:00.24] uh that are isotropic and homogeneous
[07:04.88] and given this metric you can write it
[07:06.88] as a matrix if you wish or just
[07:08.56] keep track of all the components you can
[07:10.16] go ahead and just use the formula that
[07:11.84] we introduced many lectures ago on
[07:13.68] the crystal symbols and you can go and
[07:14.96] calculate the crystal symbols and you
[07:16.56] should
[07:17.60] with any luck i didn't if i didn't make
[07:20.08] a transcription error and if you didn't
[07:21.52] make any errors you should arrive at
[07:22.80] this list of
[07:23.60] crystal symbols
[07:26.88] and now after that we're not done right
[07:30.32] the crystal symbols do contain all the
[07:32.08] information you you do need
[07:33.76] to write out einstein's field equations
[07:38.24] but of course einstein's field equations
[07:39.84] pertain to the richie tense or rather
[07:41.84] more more uh
[07:44.32] directly to the to the einstein tensor
[07:48.56] so we need to work out the ritchie
[07:50.00] tensor and therefore the einstein sensor
[07:51.76] so here we go again
[07:52.88] more calculations later
[07:55.92] long list of components for this
[08:01.12] tensor
[08:11.04] so these calculations you cannot find in
[08:12.80] world you have to
[08:15.52] in wald's textbook he doesn't really
[08:17.20] cover the case where k
[08:18.80] is not zero which is a bit of a shame
[08:22.64] but then again the textbook was written
[08:25.36] before we
[08:26.00] understood that the universe is
[08:27.52] expanding and accelerated the expansion
[08:30.16] is accelerating
[08:39.28] which is a pretty amazing result
[08:43.12] okay so here's the actual the non-zero
[08:45.04] components for the richie tensa
[08:47.92] note that there's only a handful of
[08:49.36] non-zero ones and that the
[08:51.04] rigid tense is diagonal
[08:54.40] and here's the richie scala go ahead and
[08:56.72] just add up
[08:57.68] take the trace of that thing above
[08:59.12] remember when you take the trace you
[09:00.32] have to use the inverse of the metric in
[09:02.00] there somewhere
[09:04.16] so that's why this takes this form here
[09:11.76] and now we've got almost enough stuff to
[09:14.24] write out the einstein tensor
[09:18.96] so let's now write out the einstein
[09:20.48] tensor so there's a g-tail towel
[09:22.72] term this is
[09:26.08] again an exercise for you to confirm
[09:27.84] these
[09:29.52] i mean i did these calculations myself
[09:31.68] it really didn't take so long
[09:52.88] and then the next two more
[09:55.92] components there's a theta theta
[10:02.84] component
[10:05.92] and there's a firefight component
[10:22.72] and now we have enough information to
[10:24.64] write out einstein's field equations we
[10:26.96] have the stress energy tensor
[10:28.48] remember we discussed that form of the
[10:30.88] stress energy tensor for an isotropic
[10:32.32] homogenous universe in the previous
[10:33.60] lecture
[10:34.88] and we also exploited those symmetries
[10:38.88] to write out einstein's field equations
[10:41.68] in a much simpler form and we arrived at
[10:43.76] really two independent
[10:45.36] equations that we need to worry about
[11:00.16] and so let's write it out so here here
[11:02.56] they are g a b
[11:04.00] plus lambda the cosmological constant
[11:05.92] times by the metric little g
[11:07.44] a b is going to equal eight pi t
[11:10.72] a b
[11:17.52] and we can either use the result from
[11:20.08] the previous lecture or
[11:21.20] more directly which is what i'll just do
[11:22.72] here
[11:24.32] is look at some various components of
[11:25.92] this equation will be actually be able
[11:27.52] to quickly identify the independent
[11:30.00] equations so if you look at the tt
[11:32.56] component
[11:33.28] or the tau tau component
[11:37.04] and substitute in the richie tensor
[11:38.72] einstein tensor blah blah blah blah you
[11:40.32] just arrived
[11:41.44] then you arrive at the following
[11:43.12] equation which we'll call one
[11:44.64] prime
[11:52.40] and if you look at the rr component
[11:59.68] then well a little calculation later
[12:12.32] including cosmological constant here
[12:22.56] would lead us to the second
[12:25.92] equation of course there are several
[12:27.52] more components
[12:29.44] but none of those lead to independent
[12:31.20] equations after these two
[12:41.68] and we'll call this one ii prime
[12:52.80] so these are two equations and you just
[12:55.12] go ahead and solve them if you want
[12:57.04] one prime and two prime that's totally
[12:58.88] fine uh
[13:01.04] you can do it but the you can
[13:04.64] make your life a touch simpler by
[13:08.40] combining these equations in various
[13:10.00] ways differentiating them and
[13:11.92] eliminating common terms and
[13:16.00] when you do so
[13:22.00] you will find that those equations one
[13:25.04] prime and two prime
[13:27.12] are equivalent to the following
[13:29.68] equations
[13:30.40] which we will make reference to as a
[13:32.80] little later when we solve
[13:35.44] solve these
[13:49.36] but before we go ahead and solve these
[13:51.04] equations we're going to note that this
[13:53.04] cosmological constant term lambda
[13:56.48] can be eliminated and the way it gets
[14:00.84] eliminated
[14:04.80] it gives you a sense of how or what role
[14:08.08] the lambda the cosmological constant
[14:10.16] term plays
[14:16.88] so let's make this the following
[14:18.16] substitution
[14:19.92] rho gets mapped to rho plus lambda over
[14:22.48] eight pi
[14:23.60] and p gets mapped to p
[14:26.88] minus lambda over eight pi so if you
[14:29.12] make that substitution
[14:31.76] actually you can eliminate lambda
[14:37.92] in this way we can actually interpret
[14:39.60] the cosmological constant
[14:41.36] we can interpret it as representing a
[14:43.28] form of energy
[14:47.60] with a negative pressure
[15:07.28] and this pressure is not only negative
[15:09.52] it's equal in magnitude
[15:11.04] to its energy density
[15:37.76] that means that a little p equals minus
[15:40.48] rho for this form
[15:41.68] of energy this is this energy as a name
[15:46.96] it's called dark energy
[15:54.40] and there have been several independent
[15:58.72] surveys of of this hypothetical dark
[16:02.56] energy
[16:03.12] and so far we haven't been able to
[16:05.28] reject the hypothesis that dark energy
[16:07.44] is present in our universe and
[16:08.80] dominating
[16:09.92] in fact or playing a dominating role in
[16:12.96] the
[16:13.28] uh the late stage evolution of our
[16:15.68] universe
[16:19.12] and that is so
[16:22.24] the discussion up to this point uh about
[16:24.80] eliminating lambda is just to
[16:26.40] allow us to eliminate lambda from the
[16:28.16] equations so we've got these equations 1
[16:30.40] prime and 2 prime here
[16:31.92] lambda's inside it but we can make this
[16:34.32] particular substitution
[16:35.60] and then we can end up with some
[16:37.76] equations
[16:40.80] which don't feature lambda anymore
[16:48.56] but now we have to bear in mind that the
[16:50.80] pressure can go negative
[16:54.96] or we must allow for the pressure to go
[16:57.68] negative
[16:59.84] in order to accommodate the
[17:06.00] presence of dark energy
[17:10.96] so these are the two equations that
[17:13.36] we're going to use
[17:14.32] to model the evolution of our universe
[17:22.08] and we'll call these one and two
[17:33.76] and just by looking at these equations
[17:35.20] we can actually deduce a fair number of
[17:36.88] interesting
[17:37.76] uh observations about
[17:41.36] the evolution of various
[17:45.68] types of universe
[17:49.60] so there's one case that you might think
[17:52.00] is highly relevant for the universe we
[17:53.52] find ourselves in
[17:55.28] um but in the end of course has been
[17:56.72] rejected by the latest
[18:00.64] observations you might imagine that in
[18:02.88] our universe
[18:03.76] rho the energy density is positive and
[18:06.88] uh
[18:07.20] p the pressure is also non-negative
[18:09.04] right you might imagine that
[18:11.04] and then in that case so this does not
[18:13.52] to repeat this does not actually apply
[18:15.12] to the universe that we live in
[18:16.80] as far as we know now p
[18:19.84] there is the cosmological constant term
[18:21.60] that does
[18:24.80] uh feature a negative pressure
[18:26.84] contribution
[18:29.76] but what if we um just assume
[18:35.52] that rho is strictly greater than zero
[18:37.92] and p is not negative
[18:41.28] well we can uh we can actually deduce a
[18:43.52] couple of
[18:45.44] quite interesting observations
[18:52.08] namely that the universe in this
[18:54.40] particular case
[18:58.00] cannot be static
[19:05.28] because
[19:09.36] a double dot is strictly less than zero
[19:11.28] so if you take a look at the
[19:12.48] equation two and
[19:15.68] you look at the right hand side well you
[19:16.96] see that rho and p are
[19:18.72] non-negative so the right hand side is
[19:20.48] strictly negative
[19:22.16] a itself is positive so that tells us
[19:25.52] that a double dot
[19:26.48] is strictly negative
[19:29.60] and what does that mean
[19:32.72] well uh the universe must always be
[19:34.96] contracting or expanding
[19:57.52] right because that means that a dot has
[20:00.08] to be strictly greater than zero
[20:01.52] or a dot has to be strictly less than
[20:04.24] zero a dot can't be zero
[20:06.88] otherwise a double dot would be zero
[20:12.40] so the universe is either always
[20:15.04] expanding or contracting except in the
[20:16.88] case where this cosmological constant
[20:18.56] term
[20:19.28] happens to just balance out
[20:22.40] the uh the contribution of the
[20:23.92] cosmological constant term just balances
[20:25.68] out the
[20:26.08] energy density indeed that was the
[20:27.44] original motivation that
[20:29.28] einstein to introduce the cosmological
[20:31.08] constant um
[20:35.04] now of course later observations
[20:37.12] confirmed
[20:38.72] the rejected the hypothesis that the
[20:40.88] universe is static
[20:42.64] and so somewhat melodramatically this is
[20:45.12] uh
[20:45.92] this is considered a mistake but of
[20:47.44] course with hindsight now we understand
[20:49.28] that
[20:50.08] the way you should do physics is you
[20:51.36] should include all terms that are
[20:53.20] allowed by the symmetries of your theory
[20:54.88] and
[20:55.12] the cosmological constant term is
[20:56.40] allowed by the the
[20:58.48] symmetries of your theory it's one
[20:59.92] constant term and it's non-zero
[21:02.16] as far as we're aware in our universe so
[21:03.68] i find it a bit melodramatic to
[21:05.28] to depict the cosmological constant as a
[21:07.68] mistake of einstein this is really
[21:10.08] um the motivation may have been
[21:14.84] uh with
[21:16.72] uh it may not have been courageous
[21:18.48] enough but the the
[21:20.88] principle that you add in all the the
[21:23.04] terms that are allowed by the symmetries
[21:24.56] of your theory
[21:25.60] is a good principle and uh one that you
[21:28.48] should follow when formulating physical
[21:30.24] theories
[21:30.96] it you shouldn't set any coupling
[21:33.92] constant or
[21:36.24] interaction term in your theory to zero
[21:37.76] unless you have a good reason to do so
[21:39.36] based on experimental
[21:41.04] evidence now uh
[21:44.80] when you think that the universe is
[21:46.16] expanding maybe you sort of think of
[21:48.08] um there being a distinguished point
[21:49.84] where expansion is happening around it
[21:51.84] perhaps
[21:52.80] uh you shouldn't really think of the
[21:54.16] universe like that you should rather
[21:55.36] think of galaxies as being distributed
[21:57.12] like on the surface of a balloon
[21:59.52] and uh and then your the universe is
[22:01.44] sort of blowing up the balloon or the
[22:02.88] balloon is shrinking
[22:04.24] and that means that all the distances
[22:05.76] between isotropic observers
[22:07.68] um uh there's no preferred center right
[22:11.12] we already know that
[22:12.08] and the distance is all sort of
[22:14.00] symmetrically changing
[22:16.72] between isotropic observers
[22:20.00] so
[22:23.44] let's actually think about or study the
[22:25.44] the distances between isotropic
[22:27.04] observers and see
[22:28.08] how they're changing in one of these
[22:30.00] solutions
[22:35.68] so imagine we have two isotropic
[22:37.44] observers
[22:38.72] a distance capital r apart
[22:53.52] and that's at some proper time t
[22:56.56] or some constant
[23:00.08] tau sorry so let's just study
[23:04.00] how the distance between two isotropic
[23:06.08] observers changes as
[23:08.08] tau changes
[23:14.64] well firstly the change in this distance
[23:16.72] r is
[23:18.40] per definition right it's d r d tau
[23:21.92] that's how it changes
[23:23.76] but that's equal to r on a
[23:27.04] times d a d tau which is
[23:31.20] the definition something called h times
[23:33.20] r now to to get the second line here you
[23:37.52] have to
[23:38.16] to to note that the metric
[23:41.92] is changing with uh according with tau
[23:46.96] and that the distance between two
[23:48.88] isotropic observers is being rescaled
[23:51.12] as tower changes right and a
[23:54.24] is the scaling factor
[23:57.76] and so what we've done here is we've
[23:59.92] introduced something called
[24:02.84] h
[24:05.12] which is which is irritatingly called
[24:08.64] hubble's constant although it's not
[24:10.40] constant
[24:16.24] humble's function so
[24:22.32] let's put a scarecrow here it's not
[24:24.96] constant
[24:29.52] and so what we learn is that the change
[24:31.84] in the distance between two isotopic
[24:33.20] observers
[24:33.84] is somehow proportional or
[24:38.08] instantaneously proportional to the
[24:39.84] distance between
[24:41.12] the observers right this basically
[24:43.44] exponential
[24:44.96] uh separation
[24:48.96] and what does that tell us well if r is
[24:51.60] large enough
[24:56.32] then easily right
[25:00.32] v can exceed the speed of light
[25:10.16] but that's bad right things aren't
[25:11.84] allowed to travel at faster than the
[25:13.60] speed of light
[25:14.72] well actually that's not true in general
[25:16.48] relativity uh
[25:18.64] you got to be a little bit more careful
[25:19.84] about how you you you state
[25:22.00] the the the speed of light and the
[25:25.28] the speed of light is a limit on
[25:27.68] velocities
[25:28.88] this actually entails no particular
[25:30.32] violation this observation
[25:31.92] of relativity because in general
[25:34.00] relativity all that we required is that
[25:35.76] locally measured relative velocities at
[25:37.76] a single event does not
[25:39.44] exceed the speed of light global
[25:41.36] relative velocities such as v
[25:43.28] you see the distance between two
[25:44.56] isotropic observers is
[25:46.40] this global distance quantity that's
[25:49.20] determined by a geodesic
[25:51.12] there's no no such restriction on those
[25:54.16] those velocities and actually you know
[25:57.04] you've seen in the exercises
[25:59.84] um i've mentioned that desider as an
[26:02.88] ideology universe is an idealized
[26:04.80] solution by transfer equations features
[26:06.56] exactly this
[26:08.40] so this is no violation
[26:13.28] of relativity
[26:24.80] because in real in general relativity
[26:26.72] only locally
[26:32.24] measured relative velocities
[26:39.20] so locally means some infinitesimally
[26:42.96] closed
[26:45.52] observers
[26:49.36] at a single event
[26:59.20] do not exceed the speed of light
[27:10.96] global relative velocities
[27:21.68] such as v are not
[27:25.60] so constrained
[27:28.72] and indeed we do observe this
[27:35.12] so i've alluded to it several times and
[27:36.72] stated directly several times
[27:39.68] the universe is expanding the uh the
[27:42.88] you can look at the redships of various
[27:44.40] galaxies and you can confirm that the
[27:46.64] universe is expanding
[27:53.52] so given that the universe is expand
[27:56.16] expanding
[27:57.36] a dot is bigger than zero
[28:00.40] what do we know well we know that a
[28:02.96] double dot is less than zero
[28:07.36] so what does that tell us well that
[28:08.72] tells us that the universe must have
[28:10.24] been accelerating
[28:11.76] at a faster and faster rate as t tau
[28:15.12] goes in the negative direction
[28:28.16] this is true even the cosmological
[28:29.60] concept term here
[28:32.48] in the cases that are relevant for us
[28:59.84] all right has to be right the universe
[29:04.24] a double dot is strictly negative the
[29:06.32] only way this is consistent
[29:08.00] is if everything was accelerating faster
[29:10.16] and faster and faster and faster as tau
[29:11.76] goes negative
[29:14.00] even at constant expansion
[29:21.76] you know forget x the fact that it
[29:23.12] actually was accelerating even at
[29:24.88] constant expansion
[29:28.96] then at a time
[29:32.40] t given by a dot divided by a which is
[29:34.72] like the inverse of this hubble constant
[29:36.48] which isn't a constant
[29:42.24] we would learn and this only gets worse
[29:47.84] when you include the fact that we
[29:50.56] weren't actually in a constantly
[29:51.92] expanding universe
[29:54.64] that we learned that a is zero
[29:59.44] at this time t now that's a singular
[30:03.68] state right
[30:09.68] you know the metric has the the spatial
[30:12.16] contribution to the metric has an a in
[30:13.76] front of it
[30:14.48] and if a is zero then that means the
[30:17.28] distance is between all events
[30:19.60] at that instant of time
[30:23.12] is zero
[30:41.04] zero right all events in the universe at
[30:43.60] that that instant
[30:44.88] t are at the same location
[30:51.04] and hence if there's any energy density
[30:53.28] or matter density
[30:54.40] present at that point
[31:00.96] well it would be infinite
[31:07.84] and so this has been given a name right
[31:09.36] this is called the the big bang
[31:14.16] that instant where the universe comes
[31:17.52] into being
[31:19.12] and all matter or energy density in the
[31:21.36] universe
[31:22.24] is concentrated on a singular point
[31:26.64] and then the universe after that instant
[31:28.88] commences expansion
[31:31.60] uh but i want to emphasize that this is
[31:35.12] not an explosion of pre-existing matter
[31:46.72] there was no before tea
[32:05.04] so there was no time the universe didn't
[32:07.92] simply didn't exist it was no matter
[32:09.36] there was nothing before
[32:13.52] t big t
[32:18.00] and the reason is that it is impossible
[32:22.32] to extend
[32:31.36] the space-time manifold
[32:35.44] in a non-singular way in connected way
[32:43.28] i mean this is not i mean people have
[32:45.28] studied this endlessly um
[32:47.04] and there's a variety of different
[32:50.08] things that could really have happened
[32:51.60] in the real universe
[32:52.80] however theorems on singularities
[32:56.96] in the lorenz manifolds
[33:00.00] pretty much force us into the
[33:03.28] conclusion that the universe did
[33:04.64] commence somehow in a big bang
[33:06.80] scenario and that there was nothing
[33:08.48] present before this big bang
[33:12.24] this of course can be endlessly debated
[33:15.20] and but as we
[33:16.24] find out more observational evidence and
[33:19.04] as we learn about the dynamics of our
[33:20.56] universe this does seem to be the most
[33:22.80] economical hypothesis all right that's
[33:26.48] uh it for this lecture we've covered
[33:30.08] essentially a qualitative discussion of
[33:33.52] the equations governing the evolution
[33:36.88] of a homogeneous and isotropic universe
[33:39.44] and in the next lecture
[33:40.80] we will look at the quantitative
[33:42.72] solution of equations one and two we'll
[33:45.04] solve them or at least i'll write down
[33:47.28] the
[33:48.16] solutions and then we will move on
[33:51.52] to the uh final canonical topic
[33:55.04] of this lecture series namely the
[33:57.28] schwarzschild
[33:58.24] solution but that's it for now thank you
[34:00.64] very much and goodbye
