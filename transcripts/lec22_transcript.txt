[00:00.16] hello and welcome back to introduction
[00:01.84] to general relativity
[00:03.60] in this lecture we're going to study the
[00:06.08] geodesics of
[00:07.36] test masses and bodies in the
[00:10.16] schwarzschild
[00:11.04] solution we this is the
[00:14.72] calculations in this and the following
[00:16.48] lecture will allow us to actually
[00:20.48] understand some of the most significant
[00:22.48] tests of the general theory of
[00:24.48] relativity
[00:28.84] now the objective really today
[00:31.92] is to study as i said the motion of a
[00:35.12] particle
[00:36.16] in the schwarzschild solution we're not
[00:37.60] just going to study a general
[00:40.80] trajectory however we're going to study
[00:43.20] particles in motion
[00:44.40] around the outside of a heavenly body
[00:48.56] because of course we can all get an idea
[00:51.12] of what the trajectory of a test mass
[00:53.84] that actually impacts the sun
[00:57.28] will be um you know there won't be any
[00:59.76] particle
[01:00.56] after it impacts the surface of the sun
[01:03.44] so we're only going to worry about test
[01:05.04] masses that go
[01:06.08] around the exterior of a heavenly body
[01:10.64] such as the sun and uh
[01:13.92] so if we draw the sun here right
[01:18.64] blob of superheated
[01:22.88] gas then we're interested in
[01:25.36] trajectories
[01:26.48] which orbit around say the sun or some
[01:29.12] star or something
[01:33.36] and uh we're going to
[01:36.80] introduce some notation before we get
[01:39.28] into the full
[01:41.60] derivation of this trajectory so our
[01:43.44] goal is this black line to understand
[01:45.20] this black line
[01:50.96] so if this this back line here this is
[01:53.12] the curve on the question
[01:54.72] called gamma maybe
[02:00.40] so for a curve gamma
[02:05.76] and we we demanded this curve is
[02:08.24] parameterized by
[02:10.00] some
[02:13.36] parameter let's call that parameter tau
[02:18.32] we're going to introduce the notation u
[02:20.24] a uh is the for the tangent vector
[02:25.36] to the curve
[02:36.80] we're going to also use the
[02:38.80] schwarzschild coordinate systems
[02:47.12] so in that case it makes sense to
[02:48.64] actually express ua
[02:50.24] as a in the coordinate basis
[02:58.00] in which case we use the greek letter
[03:00.08] now to denote the index
[03:02.72] because we're using a specific
[03:03.84] coordinate system and these
[03:05.92] uh components are nothing other than the
[03:07.92] derivatives of the
[03:10.32] the coordinates with respect to the
[03:11.84] parameter tau
[03:15.20] now we're only going to focus on
[03:16.32] time-like geodesics we could
[03:18.56] we will focus in the next lecture on
[03:20.32] null geodesics
[03:21.84] um there's not really any point in
[03:24.00] focusing on space like geodesics
[03:26.32] [Music]
[03:28.08] unless you believe that there exist
[03:29.44] particles that moves by faster than the
[03:31.12] speed of light
[03:39.92] so for time like here does x tell this
[03:42.00] parameter we're going to choose it to be
[03:43.60] the proper time
[03:51.36] that affords us some simplifications
[03:57.92] in the case where we we consider null
[04:00.32] geodesics
[04:03.92] light rays we're gonna
[04:07.36] we can no longer choose tail to be the
[04:09.12] proper time it doesn't make any sense
[04:11.20] um we're gonna choose it to be the
[04:13.84] affine
[04:14.96] parameter which is defined as follows
[04:21.76] you just choose tau so that
[04:27.28] the covering derivative of u
[04:30.40] along the tangent vector vanishes
[04:34.48] remember there's an extra affine
[04:38.16] freedom in choosing these curve
[04:40.32] parameters
[04:41.36] so that this equation is only satisfied
[04:43.44] for one particular choice
[04:47.76] now remember we're in the uh in the
[04:50.72] plane
[04:51.28] right
[04:55.60] in the previous lecture we discussed
[04:57.68] symmetries of the previous lectures
[04:59.36] symmetries of the schwarzschild solution
[05:01.44] one of the key symmetries is rotational
[05:03.20] invariance
[05:08.24] and without loss of generality
[05:15.04] we can choose theta the theta coordinate
[05:17.36] just to be the pi over two
[05:24.24] so now we can investigate the length
[05:28.16] of our tangent vector to the curve
[05:32.40] and this will turn out to be very useful
[05:33.68] formula
[05:35.44] so the length with respect to the metric
[05:38.88] of this tangent to the
[05:40.08] trajectory of this free particle moving
[05:42.88] in the schwarzschild in
[05:44.16] under the gravitation of this heavenly
[05:45.60] or celestial body
[05:48.00] is has admits the following formula in
[05:50.16] terms of components
[06:01.20] and depending on whether or not you have
[06:03.52] a time like or null
[06:05.60] geodesic this is either one or zero
[06:09.76] right because if it's time like we're
[06:11.52] using
[06:14.72] proper time and we're normalizing this
[06:19.36] to one
[06:24.72] since it turns out to be quite a useful
[06:26.16] formula
[06:29.68] so we'll box it up
[06:38.72] then
[06:39.33] [Music]
[06:42.16] we also know something more from the
[06:44.00] previous lecture
[06:46.64] see at this stage i should pause and say
[06:48.96] what's up what are we trying to do here
[06:50.24] we're trying to solve
[06:51.36] um we're trying to solve
[06:54.96] for these coefficients here
[07:05.28] so what are we doing at the moment
[07:10.16] well we aim to solve for the position
[07:13.20] of our test mass right whatever given
[07:15.28] some initial conditions
[07:18.40] so we've got t we aim to solve for t
[07:21.76] r and phi and also theta right
[07:25.84] but that that actually equals pi over 2
[07:28.08] by the symmetries of the problem
[07:30.32] and so what we're going to do is we're
[07:31.60] going to write down enough equations
[07:33.68] that can deliver
[07:34.80] us the derivatives a complete set of
[07:36.64] ordinary differential equations
[07:38.08] for t r and phi
[07:45.20] and uh
[07:49.84] we're gonna be you know you can just
[07:51.28] write out the geodesic equation right
[07:52.64] there's one strategy that you could do
[07:54.56] it's it's it's a procedural strategy
[07:58.16] you don't have to think you write down
[08:00.08] the geodesic equation
[08:02.16] and that's all fine and good and you can
[08:04.16] do that and in fact in some textbooks
[08:06.16] they really do write out the
[08:07.44] geodesic equation using the crystal
[08:10.96] symbols that you find
[08:12.16] for the schwarzschild solution however
[08:14.24] it turns out to be
[08:15.52] um
[08:18.88] a far more economical way to get to the
[08:22.16] complete set of differential equations
[08:25.12] for tr
[08:26.00] and phi
[08:29.52] we could use geodesic equation
[08:37.92] however there is a much more economical
[08:41.12] way
[08:47.92] and that's using and this is the way
[08:49.92] that we use
[08:50.96] also this is pretty much the strategy
[08:53.84] when one exploits
[08:55.20] classically in the newtonian world
[08:59.36] and that is to use constants of the
[09:06.84] motion
[09:10.96] so that's actually if you write down
[09:12.80] enough constants of the motion
[09:14.40] well you've our
[09:17.76] you've completely determined the the
[09:19.84] trajectory
[09:20.96] now because the schwarzschild solution
[09:22.40] has so many symmetries
[09:24.40] and uh we're going to be able to write
[09:26.96] down quite a few constants of the motion
[09:28.80] more than one and that turns out and
[09:31.60] will turn out to be
[09:32.56] enough to determine the trajectory
[09:37.12] so thanks to this proposition
[09:40.88] in the previous lecture remember this
[09:42.72] proposition about
[09:45.28] killing
[09:48.72] vector fields
[09:52.24] and geodesics
[10:01.76] so we proved that if you have a vector
[10:05.20] a killing vector and a geodesic then the
[10:07.28] inner product of the geodesic
[10:09.28] tangent vector and the killing vector is
[10:11.12] constant
[10:12.80] it's a pretty important
[10:16.48] result because it gives us constants of
[10:18.72] the motion
[10:22.88] if you the more killing vector feels you
[10:24.32] have the more constants of the motion
[10:27.84] so there it is right the inner product
[10:29.28] of psi aua
[10:31.52] which is just the metric right times psi
[10:34.40] a upper uv
[10:44.84] upper
[10:55.84] so the more killing vector fields you
[10:57.20] have the more constants of the motion
[10:58.64] you have
[11:01.12] that's a pretty impressive and useful
[11:03.12] result
[11:04.64] because some solutions
[11:08.24] to to the einstein's field equations
[11:11.36] they have natural nice big isometry
[11:14.00] groups and associated to an isometry
[11:15.60] group as a killing vector field and
[11:16.80] association
[11:17.84] killing vector field constants of the
[11:19.44] motion
[11:21.92] so let's choose our first and favorite
[11:23.60] always uh killing vector field the one
[11:25.76] that generates time translations
[11:30.88] and correspondingly to this
[11:35.84] vector field we have the following
[11:39.52] constant of the motion
[11:40.80] which has a name right what what is it
[11:43.92] that doesn't change as time
[11:45.68] passes well we give it a name in physics
[11:49.12] that's called the energy right
[11:52.40] although in general relativity one must
[11:55.44] be very careful about what one calls the
[11:57.44] the energy
[12:00.72] um because you also
[12:03.71] [Music]
[12:05.12] have to incorporate the gravitational
[12:06.40] field itself so actually the question of
[12:08.64] what's the energy of some of the volume
[12:10.56] of space-time including test particles
[12:12.32] and so on is can be difficult
[12:15.44] to make precise
[12:24.72] we'll continue to call this the energy
[12:27.44] um
[12:28.08] despite these subtleties because um
[12:32.00] in the special relativistic limit
[12:35.68] this really is the energy
[12:48.08] so if you try and solve for the motion
[12:49.76] in special relativity
[12:59.60] then you get the this quantity e is the
[13:02.00] energy per unit mass
[13:08.40] of a particle in
[13:18.32] measured by a static observer
[13:22.16] but it ultimately whether or not it's
[13:23.84] the energy or it doesn't really matter
[13:25.04] for our role
[13:25.84] uh today which is to solve for the
[13:28.00] motion
[13:28.96] so for the trajectory or the geodesic
[13:30.80] followed by a free particle
[13:33.76] so all you should really note is that i
[13:36.08] equation i
[13:36.88] is got a constant on the left hand and
[13:39.12] on the right hand side a derivative of t
[13:41.52] that'll allow us to uh that delivers us
[13:44.56] one ordinary differential equation
[13:46.88] actually we have two now
[13:48.08] because remember we got equation star
[13:50.00] equation star is
[13:51.12] also a differential equation for
[13:53.12] involving tr and phi
[13:54.64] so we have two differential equations
[13:56.40] now involving t r and phi
[13:59.36] once we have a third we'll have enough
[14:01.04] and we'll be able to solve for the
[14:02.32] motion
[14:04.96] so a little bit more on the
[14:06.48] interpretation of this e thing in the
[14:08.08] null case
[14:09.04] um you can think uh
[14:12.24] think of h by e as representing
[14:16.64] um now we're using invoking quantum
[14:18.24] mechanics a little the total energy of
[14:20.32] the photon
[14:26.80] now that's this is a constant of the
[14:28.40] motion corresponding to the killing
[14:29.60] vector field of time translations
[14:31.20] there's another cooling vector field
[14:33.44] that we haven't spent yet we spent one
[14:36.32] in just
[14:37.36] restricting our attention to the
[14:38.80] equatorial plane right we spent one
[14:40.64] symmetry that way we have spent a second
[14:42.48] one time
[14:43.04] translation now to get the this energy
[14:45.20] constant of motion
[14:46.32] we have one other generator of
[14:49.28] symmetries
[14:52.24] namely a second rotation right
[14:55.28] rotation's about by phi
[15:05.12] so you can look at the the generator of
[15:07.92] a rotation
[15:09.92] in the phi coordinate
[15:13.20] that gives you an another killing vector
[15:15.44] field psi
[15:16.40] a and
[15:19.44] corresponding to that we also get a
[15:20.96] constant of motion
[15:33.36] and we're going to call this
[15:34.80] concentration suggestively
[15:36.72] l right for various reasons
[15:41.12] as we'll see
[15:47.52] and you can interpret this one really as
[15:49.52] the angular momentum
[15:50.80] per unit rest mass of a particle
[15:54.40] on the trajectory or as the
[15:57.60] quantum angular momentum of a photon
[16:43.04] so you can think of this h by l is the
[16:45.36] angular momentum of a photon
[16:48.24] you don't have to l is a constant
[16:51.28] e is a constant and this equation here
[16:54.48] has a constant right hand side
[16:56.80] you can choose to interpret these
[16:58.40] constants you don't have to
[17:02.96] uh
[17:06.32] interestingly if you look at the right
[17:07.84] hand side of equation two
[17:10.48] you should recognize this from orbital
[17:13.36] mechanics in the newtonian setting
[17:19.76] so constancy of l
[17:23.12] in newtonian physics
[17:29.44] is uh kepler's second law right
[17:36.32] which means that equal area is swept out
[17:38.56] in equal times
[17:41.68] okay we've got three equations now we've
[17:43.52] got equation star
[17:45.36] which is a differential equation we've
[17:47.44] got equation one which is a differential
[17:49.20] equation we've got different
[17:50.72] equation two which is a differential
[17:52.08] equation and
[17:53.92] we could just try and brute force solve
[17:55.92] these nonlinear
[17:57.20] couple differential equations but
[17:58.56] actually we got like we get lucky
[18:02.56] and it's pretty easy just to to solve
[18:04.72] these equations we can eliminate quite a
[18:06.32] few already
[18:14.80] so just by simply substituting 1 and 2
[18:16.96] into star
[18:18.80] we get an equation very useful equation
[18:28.80] that will almost
[18:33.12] give us the solution already
[18:36.24] and you'll see what i mean by almost in
[18:40.84] second
[18:54.40] and so this kappa is a constant equals
[18:57.84] plus one for time-like and zero for null
[19:12.16] now why do i say almost so well check it
[19:15.28] out right this equation
[19:17.60] has two bits to it this firstly there's
[19:20.64] a
[19:21.04] half r dot squared and secondly i mean
[19:24.56] well the zeroth observation is like this
[19:26.80] equation involves only
[19:27.92] r so it's an ordinary differential
[19:30.08] equation involving r
[19:32.48] that's already pretty fantastic we've
[19:34.08] reduced the whole problem to quadratures
[19:35.60] now
[19:36.32] so what we've got is we've got um i'll
[19:38.56] suggestively label
[19:39.92] the two terms here uh the first term as
[19:42.48] a kinetic energy type term and the
[19:44.72] second
[19:45.60] term as a kind of potential energy like
[19:47.68] term and the right hand side is kind of
[19:49.04] like
[19:49.68] an energy total energy type term
[19:54.80] and if you look at this equation you
[19:56.80] know with
[19:58.08] thinking about those words then you
[19:59.92] should recognize this equation
[20:01.84] that we've in the red box here the
[20:03.60] yellow box
[20:04.96] you should really recognize this as a uh
[20:07.44] equation of motion for a particle
[20:09.76] a free particle of unit mass uh in
[20:13.60] under the influence of this potential
[20:15.28] strange potential here
[20:17.28] and with the total energy half e squared
[20:22.88] now this is sort of one of the most
[20:26.16] familiar
[20:27.04] aspects of mechanics right we've got a
[20:29.04] kinetic potential
[20:30.64] total energy uh we know how to to work
[20:34.08] with such things
[20:48.72] and we're going to import and exploit
[20:50.56] all the knowledge we have
[20:52.00] of of one-dimensional mechanics to solve
[20:55.84] this equation
[21:29.04] and uh so our strategy will be just as
[21:32.08] in classical orbital mechanics we're
[21:34.40] going to solve for the radial motion
[21:36.16] first
[21:36.72] and then we're going to use the other
[21:38.32] equations to determine
[21:39.76] the angular motion
[21:43.12] now if you look at this potential vr
[21:44.88] here that this effective potential that
[21:46.80] we've written down actually
[21:48.40] it should be pretty familiar to you from
[21:50.24] orbital mechanics like
[21:51.44] it's in fact it's comprised mostly of
[21:53.44] stuff that we already see
[21:54.80] coming in newtonian level of physics
[21:56.72] right the first three
[21:58.00] terms effectively are what you would
[22:01.36] expect
[22:01.92] from uh
[22:05.44] uh orbital mechanics the only the last
[22:07.28] term is new or
[22:09.12] presents a new
[22:13.84] additional term that's not present in
[22:15.84] the newtonian physics setting
[22:24.56] so the first three terms are very should
[22:26.16] be completely familiar from newtonian
[22:27.92] physics
[22:30.48] the uh extra term that's new
[22:34.40] is this minus ml squared over r cubed
[22:37.76] and what does it do well it
[22:41.04] it doesn't do much when r is big right
[22:43.36] it's quite a small
[22:44.48] perturbation when r is large in fact it
[22:47.68] only has a plays a role when r is small
[22:51.44] but when r is small it does a massive
[22:53.84] effect right it dominates
[22:56.64] over the centrifugal barrier
[23:13.68] and so you can already get a sense that
[23:15.68] we can expect some rather interesting
[23:17.36] behavior right
[23:20.08] uh as compared to the newtonian setting
[23:24.56] so now the goal is to solve all these
[23:26.32] equations well we're going to solve
[23:28.08] for r first right
[23:31.92] and we can do that because it's really
[23:33.20] quadratures now
[23:38.56] so if we take a look at the radial
[23:40.08] equation right you've got a first
[23:41.60] derivative of r
[23:43.76] it's got the classical kinetic plus
[23:45.60] potential energy structure
[23:47.60] we can just integrate this equation
[23:53.20] and you get the following integral
[24:00.48] and you have to take a square root along
[24:01.76] the way that's why there's a plus or
[24:03.04] minus sign there
[24:09.36] but otherwise it should be a completely
[24:12.40] straightforward exercise to verify this
[24:14.40] calculation if i haven't made a mistake
[24:22.48] and that's it we've already worked out
[24:23.84] the angular motion now
[24:30.72] oh i even skipped a step sorry about
[24:32.40] that um
[24:38.24] i've already jumped ahead
[24:42.72] so i'm not solving for r at all just
[24:45.28] realize i've written down the angular
[24:46.80] motion
[24:53.60] you can do this by eliminating
[25:01.44] uh the tau dependence
[25:04.88] from equations two and star
[25:09.60] and that's how you arrive at this
[25:10.96] equation here so what do i mean by that
[25:12.64] so if you look at equation two
[25:15.68] two's super simple right it's just r
[25:17.20] squared phi dot squared
[25:19.28] and star is the somewhat more
[25:20.64] complicated
[25:22.40] equation here and
[25:25.52] the trick here is to express
[25:28.56] i mean i'm not going to do this full
[25:29.68] calculation it's a couple of lines
[25:34.48] i'll give you some hints right you know
[25:36.40] so equation 2
[25:37.52] says that l equals r
[25:40.56] squared and i'll actually write out the
[25:42.40] derivative so you can see what's
[25:43.52] happening
[25:44.24] d tau squared so you rearrange that
[25:49.68] so that's l on r squared equals
[25:53.44] d phi squared detail oops if i del
[25:56.80] squared
[25:58.64] and now we want uh we want something
[26:02.40] like
[26:03.04] d phi d r that we can then integrate
[26:05.76] that's
[26:06.24] the objective so we don't have that
[26:09.20] right if you look at the equation two
[26:11.76] two gives us something with a proper
[26:13.28] time and we need to eliminate
[26:15.04] uh the proper time so one way to do that
[26:17.44] is you can just do
[26:18.88] do it like this right you can just say
[26:20.40] that definitely r
[26:22.16] equals well it equals definitely tau
[26:25.84] times by d tau dr
[26:29.84] okay and then that thing
[26:34.48] we can get this from star from equation
[26:37.60] star
[26:38.00] right d tail d r is just d r d tau
[26:40.56] inverted
[26:41.84] and where do we find it well we can go
[26:43.68] back to equation star and there it is
[26:46.56] it's buried in here right there it is
[26:48.16] there so r dot squared
[26:50.00] or we can yeah that's one way to do it
[27:00.88] go ahead and do it that way if you like
[27:02.56] and then you should end up hopefully
[27:04.16] with the equation that i've written down
[27:09.44] so actually i've just gone ahead forget
[27:10.96] the radio measure i just went ahead and
[27:12.32] solved for the actual
[27:13.60] um full trajectory although you could
[27:17.04] certainly
[27:17.68] solve for the radio motion and then
[27:19.76] solve the other equations
[27:21.04] to get phi
[27:25.04] and given that now we can actually
[27:27.12] analyze and study these orbits
[27:29.04] well actually we can learn a lot just by
[27:30.56] thinking about this potential in kinetic
[27:32.16] energy interpretation
[27:35.12] so the name of the game now is to
[27:36.64] actually consider these orbits to
[27:38.40] understand these orbits and now
[27:40.24] to look at their stability
[27:44.24] and actually we're going to start with
[27:45.60] stability questions
[27:56.48] so to make life simple for the rest of
[27:58.96] this lecture we're just going to focus
[28:00.16] on the time like geodesics now the
[28:01.76] knowledge of districts we leave to the
[28:02.96] next lecture
[28:05.68] and now what is a a stable orbit well a
[28:08.00] stable orbit is one where
[28:09.60] the radius does not change with time
[28:12.64] right and if we look back here when
[28:16.08] would that be well that would be
[28:17.28] an extrema of the potential energy right
[28:21.28] and i'm gonna draw some pictures to
[28:22.64] explain that in a second and so what we
[28:24.48] do is find the extrema of the potential
[28:28.84] energy
[28:42.56] so if we look at our effective potential
[28:44.16] term
[28:53.76] where where are the extrema well they're
[28:55.76] just when you take the potential and
[28:57.44] differentiate
[28:58.00] it with respect to r and set it to zero
[28:59.44] that's where the extrema are so if you
[29:01.04] do that
[29:02.48] take the potential and you do the
[29:03.76] derivative and hopefully you should
[29:05.92] arrive at this formula
[29:09.84] and we can just straight away cancel off
[29:11.36] the r to the four
[29:13.84] and we're left with a quadratic equation
[29:27.44] so we can just write write out those
[29:28.96] zeros we've got two coins we've got r
[29:30.88] plus and we get r minus
[29:37.76] from the quadratic formula
[29:44.88] and uh well you know when do we have two
[29:47.28] solutions one do we have no solutions
[29:49.68] well when the term and the square root
[29:52.00] here is
[29:52.80] negative then we don't have any real
[29:54.24] solutions any longer
[30:00.56] so in particular if l squared is less
[30:02.48] than 12 times
[30:04.16] m squared there are no extrema
[30:14.00] so the small angular momentum
[30:17.28] and what does the potential look like
[30:18.64] now well
[30:22.24] in that that kind of setting where l
[30:24.72] squared is less than 12 m squared
[30:26.88] then the potential has this kind of look
[30:30.96] there are no extrema
[30:36.00] here i've plotted it for six m squared
[30:44.24] and uh so no extrema means that if you
[30:46.48] put a particle in that potential
[30:48.08] remember
[30:48.56] the interpretation of the radial
[30:50.00] equation of motion is that of a unit
[30:51.36] mass particle moving in this potential
[30:53.44] then no matter where you stick the
[30:54.88] particle uh
[30:56.56] there is a gradient and it's going to
[30:58.72] sink down or it's going to zoom down
[31:01.44] into the center so what would that mean
[31:04.72] in terms of an orbit that would mean an
[31:06.00] orbit that spirals or just goes directly
[31:08.40] into the center of the celestial body
[31:12.88] so in that case there are no stable
[31:14.48] orbits
[31:16.16] there's not enough angular momentum that
[31:17.52] particles going in
[31:22.00] now if you've got enough angular
[31:23.92] momentum
[31:29.52] in particular you've got more than 12 m
[31:31.84] squared angular momentum
[31:34.56] then you can find the extrema
[31:38.00] according to that formula right
[31:39.60] nothing's changed the formula's still
[31:41.12] correct
[31:42.24] but you could work out that one extreme
[31:43.92] is a minima and one is a maxima
[31:49.36] you just got to do the second derivative
[31:50.88] to work out which ones are minima and
[31:52.24] which ones are maximum or you just look
[31:53.52] at the plot
[32:09.04] and what do you see well in this this
[32:11.20] sort of setting
[32:12.16] the what does the potential look like
[32:13.68] well the potential looks a little
[32:15.12] different now
[32:15.76] so uh we've got a maxima and a minima
[32:22.40] max min
[32:26.84] and here i've drawn it for c
[32:32.88] l squared equals 24 m squared
[32:43.68] and so you can see whether the maximum
[32:45.52] minima are on this particular curve
[32:48.48] but here's here's a maxima and here's a
[32:54.84] minima
[33:04.80] so this is our minus
[33:09.36] here oops
[33:16.16] that's r minus there and that's r plus
[33:18.08] there the minimum
[33:20.56] so you can see that a part a fictitious
[33:22.16] particle in this potential would sort of
[33:23.52] roll around
[33:24.48] the minima here and fall down from the
[33:26.48] maxima
[33:28.32] so in particular it tells us there are
[33:30.32] stable orbits
[33:42.48] and not only stable they are completely
[33:44.08] circular right when the radius doesn't
[33:45.68] change
[33:46.24] well phi changes that's a circular orbit
[33:53.68] r dot is zero
[34:01.44] there's also an unstable circular orbit
[34:04.56] right if you just get the particle the
[34:06.40] test mass balanced in that potential
[34:08.48] there
[34:10.56] then then it
[34:13.68] will also execute a circular orbit but
[34:15.36] of course the slightest perturbation
[34:16.64] will
[34:17.04] kick it out
[34:25.44] and in the limit right we can get to the
[34:28.08] newtonian
[34:29.04] non-relativistic limit to understand
[34:31.52] these these
[34:32.84] points
[34:36.40] r plus has the form l squared over m
[34:40.00] which is the same as the newtonian
[34:42.08] formula for the radius of the circular
[34:46.84] orbital
[35:03.84] now it's sort of important to note that
[35:10.88] r plus greater than because r plus is
[35:13.44] greater than 6m
[35:15.52] there are actually no stable orbits
[35:23.12] stable circular orbits
[35:37.20] okay that's a fairly obvious consequence
[35:40.48] another one is that the circular orbits
[35:42.48] themselves the unstable
[35:44.08] ones in a bounded region
[36:01.28] and they just lie between 3m and 6m
[36:10.96] the energy constant now so you can work
[36:12.96] out the energy
[36:14.64] of a particle
[36:17.76] in a circular orbit
[36:26.96] just substitute it into the equation
[36:28.56] above
[36:32.40] and it's a little substitution exercise
[36:34.72] so what's the
[36:35.76] energy as a function of the radius of
[36:37.60] something in a stable circular orbit
[36:39.20] well it's r minus 2 m over the square
[36:41.12] root of r
[36:46.40] square root of r minus 3m
[36:49.52] this will turn it to be kind of
[36:50.64] interesting in a second
[37:06.84] and
[37:11.28] so the small radii like for r less than
[37:13.76] four m
[37:15.68] the energy is greater than one
[37:20.16] and uh
[37:26.32] so if we take a look then we can
[37:30.96] see that if you have a particle perched
[37:33.44] at the top of this potential
[37:35.28] i mean it's kind of obvious from the
[37:36.40] picture right if you've got a particle
[37:38.48] in an unstable circular orbit
[37:41.04] uh perched at the top of this potential
[37:43.76] and you give it a little um perturbation
[37:45.76] outwards then you'll see that it escapes
[37:47.36] to infinity right it just flies off the
[37:49.12] potential it has enough energy to carry
[37:51.20] it
[37:51.44] out to infinity
[38:02.80] of course if you put a perturb the
[38:04.96] particle inwards then it will
[38:07.60] collapse it'll plummet into the center
[38:44.56] all right now let's understand stable
[38:47.36] circular orbits
[38:51.52] and in particular perturbations of
[38:53.52] stable circular orders
[38:55.12] this will lead us to one of the most
[38:56.48] celebrated predictions of
[38:58.16] einstein's general theory of relativity
[39:04.56] well confirmations rather than
[39:06.24] predictions as you'll see
[39:14.88] so let's suppose we have a particle
[39:18.72] in a stable circular orbit
[39:26.40] what does that mean on our potential
[39:27.92] diagram so our fictitious
[39:30.00] unit mass particle will be in that
[39:33.28] potential well now
[39:42.64] so we've got this little particle here
[39:47.28] and it's executing oscillations inside
[39:49.84] this potential well here
[39:59.28] around the minima r plus that's what it
[40:01.52] means to be in a stable
[40:03.04] but in a perturbation of a stable
[40:04.96] circular orbit
[40:23.44] so if you look at that potential then
[40:25.52] suppose sufficiently small
[40:27.84] distances away from r plus the potential
[40:30.16] is going to look effectively quadratic
[40:31.60] right
[40:32.00] um i mean it's got some cubic
[40:34.56] corrections
[40:35.60] but it's effectively a quadratic
[40:36.96] potential
[40:39.52] so we can just
[40:42.96] exploit that observation to really
[40:45.76] quickly
[40:46.32] get a handle on the oscillations around
[40:49.76] this minima
[40:53.52] so we're going to look at some
[40:55.44] sufficiently small
[41:04.84] displacements
[41:07.52] where the cubic corrections are coming
[41:10.08] neglected
[41:10.88] and then the particle will execute
[41:13.36] harmonic simple harmonic motion
[41:15.12] because it's a quadratic potential
[41:30.72] and what's the frequency well you just
[41:32.32] got to solve the harmonic oscillator
[41:36.72] and that is a job for you
[41:41.84] so the frequency of radial oscillations
[41:44.88] uh we'll call omega squared uh
[41:49.12] you find that by just taking the second
[41:50.72] derivative of the potential around the
[41:52.24] minima
[41:54.00] and it's just well when you work it out
[41:57.04] it's just this num this ratio here
[42:00.08] of r pluses and m's
[42:07.20] now i have to point out of course that
[42:08.72] this the time here in this
[42:11.20] uh one-dimensional classical mechanics
[42:13.76] problem is the proper time right
[42:15.28] so this is as things are measured
[42:18.16] relative to the the particle itself
[42:24.56] but to the level of approximation uh we
[42:27.76] will just set the two to eb
[42:29.20] equal
[42:42.00] so yeah it's not
[42:46.72] the schwarzschild coordinate time
[42:56.40] t right towers from t
[43:01.84] so we've already worked out now that the
[43:04.08] particles execute these little
[43:05.60] oscillations around this
[43:07.68] stable radius
[43:10.80] now the particle is also the test
[43:12.48] particle is also moving around the
[43:13.76] celestial body right once every
[43:16.96] however many uh seconds
[43:21.04] and we need to work out what is this
[43:24.96] angular frequency
[43:26.08] right how often does it go around the
[43:27.84] celestial body
[43:36.72] well you can find it by just
[43:40.24] uh defining
[43:43.28] omega phi to be phi dot right
[43:47.68] because whenever phi comes around two pi
[43:50.32] well then you executed a complete
[43:52.84] oscillation
[43:55.20] and that right is determined by the
[43:57.44] angular momentum
[43:59.36] and the radius
[44:13.20] i forgot my square here i believe
[44:20.08] actually i'm just to check that i got
[44:22.96] the angular momentum equation correct
[44:25.28] i feel like there's an extra square that
[44:26.88] i wrote down that doesn't feel right
[44:35.52] indeed i made a mistake earlier on sorry
[44:37.84] about this
[44:48.64] right that looked awful strange um
[44:52.48] so equation two has a mistake in it from
[44:55.28] earlier
[44:59.68] so do make sure to correct uh
[45:03.12] to pay attention to that you would not
[45:04.80] have been able to do
[45:06.56] some of the equations uh the exercises
[45:09.68] so i'm sure some of you may have already
[45:11.52] in fact commented
[45:13.12] by the time
[45:16.16] we got this far so okay there was a
[45:18.64] mistake there
[45:19.60] apologize for that sorry
[45:28.48] so where were we so there's definitely
[45:29.92] no squared there
[45:32.24] um okay so we're trying to solve for the
[45:34.96] angular motion
[45:36.00] of our test body well by defining
[45:39.36] omega phi just to be phi dot then we
[45:41.20] already can work out
[45:44.16] the period and therefore the frequency
[45:55.04] which is determined by the angular
[45:58.84] momentum
[46:03.76] and the angular momentum we can
[46:05.44] eliminate with the
[46:08.48] equation above which determines the zero
[46:13.12] of the circular orbit a stable circular
[46:17.36] orbit and then we work out that the
[46:18.64] angular frequency is
[46:19.76] this particular ratio here involving r
[46:22.08] plus
[46:27.52] okay very good so what right well
[46:31.84] the first thing i want to point out is
[46:33.76] that and this is
[46:35.76] uh the sort of the most normal situation
[46:38.48] with this kind of setting
[46:40.00] is that omega r is not necessarily the
[46:42.72] same as omega phi
[46:44.48] now that's a bit different to the
[46:46.08] newtonian setting so the newtonian
[46:47.76] setting things are like
[46:48.72] amazingly beautifully symmetric and
[46:50.64] wonderful there omega r and omega phi
[46:53.12] are commensurate frequencies
[46:54.88] just magically because of the the the
[46:57.44] the nature of the potential which is
[46:58.80] kind of amazing right
[47:00.72] but here in this general relativistic
[47:03.12] setting things are much less
[47:04.32] sort of much more generic and much less
[47:06.80] miraculous
[47:08.08] so uh in particular these two
[47:10.16] frequencies are inconvenient but let's
[47:12.00] first talk about where they are almost
[47:13.52] convincing it
[47:14.48] so if r plus is really large
[47:18.16] so this is the newtonian limit
[47:24.72] uh what are these angular frequencies
[47:26.96] well one of them is approximately
[47:30.56] m over r plus cubed and the other one is
[47:33.52] approximately
[47:34.72] m over r plus cubed okay so great so in
[47:37.60] the far
[47:38.08] r limit the larger our limit
[47:41.68] these two frequencies are commensurate
[47:47.36] they coincide
[48:01.60] and the orbit closes right so this is
[48:06.48] this is what you expect from the old
[48:08.32] newtonian stuff
[48:10.08] you have a heavenly body celestial body
[48:13.44] here it is here and you have
[48:17.04] a particle in motion around this
[48:21.52] this celestial body so i'm just going to
[48:23.60] draw this
[48:24.88] trajectory here say an orange
[48:28.08] so let's suppose you have a stable
[48:29.76] circular orbit around the celestial body
[48:32.40] and then you consider perturbation
[48:34.16] around this celestial
[48:35.52] body
[48:41.92] then in the newtonian limit then this
[48:44.24] thing executes this
[48:46.48] simple harmonic motion around uh
[48:49.76] the minima and the orbit closes
[48:54.80] so that's the newtonian element great
[48:56.72] fine so everything matches up with what
[48:58.64] you you know from the newtonian limit
[49:02.24] the impressive and amazing
[49:05.84] thing about general relativity
[49:10.24] is that in general omega r does not
[49:12.88] equal omega phi
[49:13.92] right these orbits uh these oscillations
[49:16.08] are inconvenient
[49:24.16] and that means the orbits do not close
[49:35.36] and we get a procession of perihelia and
[49:42.84] apelio
[49:46.00] so perihelium and aphelion are the
[49:48.96] places where the orbit
[49:50.24] is closest and furthest from the
[49:51.76] celestial body
[50:00.80] so redrawing the figure that we just had
[50:02.72] before
[50:06.80] so there's a the orange curve is the
[50:09.04] stable circular orbit
[50:15.92] consider a perturbation around the
[50:18.00] stable circular orbit
[50:19.92] now the particle oscillates as it goes
[50:22.32] around
[50:23.76] radially oscillates but these uh
[50:26.16] oscillations are inconvenient with the
[50:28.24] the circular frequency and so we get
[50:30.72] these
[50:31.36] characteristic unclosed orbits
[50:34.88] which i'm not sure if i'll go to draw
[50:42.64] right
[50:47.68] and the the point where the particles
[50:50.56] furthest from the object
[50:55.52] or closest from the object
[50:58.88] changes from orbit to orbit
[51:05.20] so the precision rate of the perihelium
[51:16.48] well there is a precession first of all
[51:19.12] that's the kind of
[51:20.40] key key prediction here
[51:25.20] and you can estimate this precession
[51:27.28] rate as being just the difference of
[51:28.72] these two frequencies
[51:30.64] and substituting those numbers in
[51:34.48] you arrive at the following formula for
[51:37.28] this precession rate
[51:42.56] and for the for the not quite newtonian
[51:45.44] limit but for the limit where r plus is
[51:46.88] a lot bigger than m
[51:48.00] this precession rate is approximately
[51:51.04] three m to the three halves
[51:57.20] r plus to the five halves now
[52:00.40] uh this is a very very small number but
[52:04.56] for certain celestial bodies it's
[52:07.28] non-trivial it's a measurable
[52:09.12] number and in particular for mercury
[52:14.80] this this is about 43 seconds of arc
[52:21.44] per century so if you observe the the
[52:23.84] orbits of
[52:25.04] mercury for 100 years you'll start to
[52:26.88] notice that the perihelion
[52:28.88] mercury are processing around and this
[52:31.20] was in fact known
[52:32.72] and this constant this calculation here
[52:34.96] constituted one of the most
[52:36.40] celebrated and stunning successes of
[52:38.64] einstein's general theory of relativity
[52:40.80] because it matched the actual
[52:42.08] observations
[52:43.60] of uh the procession of the perihelion
[52:45.92] of mercury
[52:47.68] and in the next lecture we'll be looking
[52:50.56] at another stunning
[52:51.84] prediction of einstein's general theory
[52:53.92] of relativity namely that light
[52:55.92] is uh the trajectory of light is this is
[52:58.64] curved or
[52:59.60] bend by uh the gravitational field
[53:03.52] and that will bring us essentially
[53:06.72] to the end of this course but for today
[53:09.28] we're finished
[53:10.16] thank you very much and goodbye
