[00:00.00] hello and welcome back to introduction
[00:01.60] to general relativity lecture three
[00:04.08] today in this lecture we're going to
[00:06.16] take a deep dive
[00:07.20] into the mathematics of manifolds so it
[00:10.32] is a core
[00:11.12] underlying assumption of special
[00:13.04] relativity and general relativity
[00:15.36] indeed it's a core underlying assumption
[00:17.20] of many parts of physics
[00:19.04] that a space-time is somehow a continuum
[00:22.56] a four-dimensional continuum
[00:25.12] and that you need at least locally at
[00:27.76] least locally so the idea is that
[00:30.16] although within general relativity the
[00:32.88] idea is that although
[00:33.92] space-time is not globally a
[00:37.28] flat four-dimensional continuum at least
[00:39.84] locally it is and it's certainly an
[00:41.76] underlying assumption of many other
[00:43.04] parts of physics that these
[00:44.96] that the the space or the space time in
[00:47.68] which
[00:48.00] physics takes place are continua of some
[00:50.80] sort
[00:51.68] so at this point i don't want to be very
[00:53.12] specific about what you mean by the word
[00:55.28] continua but roughly speaking we
[00:59.12] we assume that it takes to characterize
[01:01.52] events say in special relativity we need
[01:03.60] four numbers right we need the time that
[01:05.28] the event took place
[01:06.24] and three spatial uh coordinates
[01:10.72] now it's a the the fundamental uh
[01:13.60] difference between general
[01:14.80] and special relativity is that the
[01:16.48] geometry of this continuum in general
[01:18.40] relativity is something dynamical so it
[01:20.40] can move or change
[01:21.76] as as the space time evolves in response
[01:25.52] to the positions and locations and
[01:27.52] distribution of stress
[01:28.96] matter and energy in the universe
[01:32.40] now because we have the possibility with
[01:35.52] the general relativity for
[01:37.04] the geometry to change to be dynamical
[01:40.48] we need a mathematical apparatus to
[01:42.32] describe and quantify the situation this
[01:44.40] is crucial
[01:45.36] otherwise we would only ever be
[01:47.36] restricted to qualitative remarks
[01:49.44] and in course we want to do quantitative
[01:51.92] physics where we make predictions
[01:53.60] and precise predictions and confirm
[01:56.56] these hypotheses
[01:57.84] oh sorry reject hypotheses of course we
[02:00.00] cannot confirm a hypothesis
[02:01.76] in physics now there are
[02:05.84] many ways you might think of building up
[02:07.76] a mathematical theory
[02:09.12] of curved continuum
[02:12.48] and one of them and probably the
[02:14.48] simplest is
[02:16.16] to think of curved continua as somehow
[02:18.88] living
[02:20.40] inside a higher dimensional space as a
[02:23.04] kind of embedded
[02:24.64] surface so imagine we have some higher
[02:27.76] dimensional
[02:28.80] space time i don't know we'll call this
[02:32.32] like r m some ambient
[02:35.52] euclidean space time
[02:38.56] structure and we want to describe and
[02:41.36] what we need is because we think
[02:43.28] at least within the general relativity
[02:45.36] we presume most of the time we live in a
[02:47.28] four dimensional
[02:48.24] space time so we would need that somehow
[02:50.80] m is bigger than
[02:51.68] four to build up a theory
[02:54.80] of curved continua and so
[02:58.24] you could imagine building up a theory
[03:00.08] of curve continue as embedded
[03:02.48] volume surfaces inside
[03:05.92] this ambient uh big higher dimensional
[03:09.60] space
[03:10.64] rm you could do this
[03:16.84] uh
[03:18.56] and i'll just label this so you have m
[03:21.28] is
[03:23.20] in this way of thinking our space time
[03:28.24] and m lives in this bigger
[03:31.68] ambient space rm now you could do this
[03:36.80] and uh it works for the most part
[03:40.16] however it does have some operational
[03:42.80] problems or puzzles
[03:44.40] and most i think pressing me is the
[03:47.44] question do these higher dimensions
[03:49.12] exist
[03:50.96] in the end uh we sort of sidestep this
[03:53.28] problem
[03:54.16] and do things in a
[03:57.20] different way arguably more natural way
[04:00.40] namely we study curved continuum in an
[04:04.16] intrinsic way
[04:05.92] without reference to this
[04:10.64] larger embedding space-time rm
[04:14.72] so this is as rm is like in this
[04:19.68] approach this irm is what we might call
[04:21.44] the ambient space
[04:23.04] and this is the embedding approach so
[04:24.80] we're not going to do this this is not
[04:27.44] the way we're going to do the things in
[04:28.88] this course
[04:31.52] because it's just it turns out even
[04:33.84] though it's harder work to begin with
[04:35.60] it turns out it is more natural and more
[04:38.64] transferable a skill that's also
[04:40.56] something that's very important
[04:42.32] to discuss things intrinsically
[04:46.00] so we discuss curved
[04:49.92] continuum in this course
[04:54.36] intrinsically without reference
[04:58.16] to a uh ambient embedding
[05:02.08] manifold as well or space-time
[05:06.00] when you try and describe the
[05:08.24] mathematics of curved
[05:09.68] spaces and curved continua intrinsically
[05:14.00] you are led to the topic of manifolds
[05:19.12] the mathematical theory of
[05:22.16] differential geometry and manifolds and
[05:24.80] it's this mathematical theory that we
[05:26.64] are going to occupy ourselves with for
[05:28.40] the next
[05:28.96] 10 lectures or so there it is
[05:32.24] a highly demanding part of mathematics
[05:35.68] uh with respect to the maths that you've
[05:37.52] already met in your physics degree
[05:41.04] it requires a fair amount of formalism
[05:44.80] to be built up to describe
[05:46.80] which are described concepts that are
[05:48.80] arguably fairly
[05:50.88] intuitive but to do things
[05:52.80] quantitatively and precisely
[05:54.64] you do need a fair amount of
[05:56.24] infrastructure that you have to build up
[05:57.60] mathematical infrastructure
[06:00.64] really you don't need much more
[06:02.72] prerequisites than calculus and linear
[06:04.64] algebra to discuss the theory of
[06:06.40] different to discuss differential
[06:07.68] geometry and manifolds
[06:08.96] you can get away with it although we
[06:11.12] will occasionally
[06:12.40] um in this course have to encounter the
[06:15.20] concepts coming from poinset topology
[06:17.04] and general topology
[06:19.04] i will for the large part mention
[06:22.40] the words that are important uh in the
[06:25.44] theory of manifolds are coming from
[06:27.12] topology
[06:28.32] and occasionally at the ends of videos i
[06:30.48] might add a little bit of
[06:31.84] extra material that's optional for those
[06:34.16] who of you who are interested
[06:36.16] in pursuing the mathematics of
[06:39.36] differential geometry manifolds a little
[06:41.76] bit more deeper
[06:42.88] and more precisely you can take a look
[06:46.40] at this additional material that i'll
[06:47.84] add at the ends of the videos
[06:51.20] all right before we get started on the
[06:53.92] theory of
[06:55.36] differential geometry and manifolds i
[06:58.56] should
[06:59.20] spend a little bit of time setting up
[07:00.88] some notation this notation is going to
[07:02.56] be with us for the rest of the course
[07:06.00] it's vital that we spend a bit of time
[07:09.68] settling the notation
[07:12.72] otherwise things will come out of the
[07:14.80] blue and you won't know what the symbols
[07:16.24] mean
[07:17.76] so the first piece of notation is that
[07:20.40] of r
[07:21.04] n euclidean space r n
[07:24.24] which i'll denote as r to the n
[07:27.44] it's just the set of n tuples of real
[07:29.36] numbers
[07:31.52] and i'll use this underline notation for
[07:34.40] vectors
[07:35.36] of numbers or tuples n tuples of numbers
[07:38.96] we'll also have need to make reference
[07:41.04] quite often actually to the distance
[07:44.00] the euclidean distance function which is
[07:46.64] defined on
[07:47.60] our n as follows
[07:52.88] just take the difference between the
[07:54.16] coordinate square them sum them up
[07:57.04] and take the square root so the standard
[07:59.28] euclidean distance function you will
[08:00.56] definitely need to know this
[08:02.16] you'll need to know about the euclidean
[08:03.52] ball br of radius
[08:05.52] r around a point y it's the set of all
[08:08.48] points in rn
[08:10.80] such that the distance between that
[08:12.72] point
[08:14.32] x and this given point y is always less
[08:16.56] than r strictly less than
[08:17.92] r this is also called the open ball
[08:23.76] around y
[08:27.92] that's this is where we'll delicately
[08:31.68] touch upon
[08:32.48] the point set topology
[08:37.12] then we need to have the notion of an
[08:39.92] open
[08:40.40] set you
[08:44.08] this is going to
[08:47.12] for our purposes it's sufficient to
[08:50.16] think of an open set as a set
[08:53.84] u where
[08:56.88] for all points inside the set u
[09:01.12] there exists a positive
[09:04.32] potentially very small number epsilon
[09:07.20] such that the
[09:08.08] ball of radius epsilon around the point
[09:11.12] x is always within you
[09:12.80] so an open set is in rn at least is
[09:15.36] defined by this
[09:17.28] these properties we also want to talk
[09:21.04] about
[09:21.52] sets of functions so we're going to
[09:24.64] introduce the set cn
[09:26.00] which is the set of n times
[09:27.92] differentiable functions
[09:38.16] uh on rn to
[09:41.28] r we can extend this notion of n times
[09:44.88] differentiable to
[09:46.40] vector valued functions although
[09:49.44] i don't think i'll be doing that for
[09:50.96] quite a while in this course
[09:53.44] a couple of edge cases here c naught is
[09:55.76] c is
[09:57.36] referred to as the continuous functions
[10:01.76] they don't have any continuous
[10:03.20] derivatives that exist
[10:05.36] necessarily but they are at least
[10:07.52] continuous and c
[10:08.40] infinity is the infinitely
[10:10.08] differentiable
[10:13.20] and finite differentiable
[10:20.08] functions otherwise known as smooth
[10:23.28] functions
[10:25.52] so we'll certainly have occasion to
[10:26.96] refer to these a lot in this course
[10:32.00] now with this notation around we can
[10:34.16] start
[10:35.04] the the long process of defining what is
[10:37.60] meant by a manifold
[10:39.36] now i'm gonna it's it's
[10:42.56] in this course i'm gonna do everything
[10:44.80] it's pretty general um
[10:48.40] we're gonna do things in in n dimensions
[10:58.96] so you might wonder why are we doing
[11:00.56] things in n dimensions when we
[11:02.40] we pay we obviously live in a four
[11:05.04] dimensional space time
[11:07.20] well i would say there's three or four
[11:10.96] two three four really good arguments why
[11:12.96] you should think about
[11:14.00] the dimension of your space time as
[11:16.64] being
[11:17.60] allowed to change very or
[11:21.04] also where you might want to be able to
[11:23.68] focus on some cases where
[11:25.60] the dimension is say smaller than the
[11:27.68] space time you're in
[11:29.60] i'd say arguably
[11:33.12] the first reason why you should do
[11:34.48] things in n dimensions in this course is
[11:36.24] that it doesn't really cost that much
[11:37.52] more
[11:38.00] effort to do it so why not you get a lot
[11:40.72] of generality for free that's one good
[11:42.48] reason why you might want to consider
[11:43.60] things in arbitrary dimensions
[11:45.52] second thing is we often want to
[11:48.40] restrict
[11:49.04] to a special example where the dynamics
[11:52.16] are restricted to
[11:53.04] a lower dimensional hyperplane or
[11:56.16] hypersurface in space-time
[11:58.16] you could think of the dynamics of a
[11:59.84] particle restricted to move on the
[12:01.52] surface of a sphere for example that's
[12:03.76] that's a case where you might want to
[12:05.52] consider a space time of
[12:06.80] effectively lower dimension so there is
[12:08.48] effectively level a third reason
[12:11.12] is much much deeper and comes arguably
[12:13.52] from quantum gravity
[12:14.64] there are strong indications that the
[12:16.32] dimension of the space time we're in
[12:18.64] which it seemed to be for um
[12:21.92] might be emergent from a different
[12:24.88] space-time dimension
[12:27.60] there there's hints from the so-called
[12:29.28] holographic principle in quantum gravity
[12:32.48] another reason why you might want to
[12:34.40] consider higher dimensions
[12:36.56] lower dimensions or arbitrary dimensions
[12:38.64] is is that in quantum gravity we should
[12:40.88] arguably
[12:41.84] be allowed to take superpositions of
[12:43.76] space time
[12:44.88] and there's no principle that says that
[12:46.72] we must be taking sp
[12:48.16] superpositions over space times of the
[12:49.76] same dimension so this is
[12:52.08] a whole sort of grab bag of reasons why
[12:54.08] you might want to consider
[12:56.08] formulating your physics in arbitrary
[12:58.16] dimensions
[12:59.12] but you know for the most part it just
[13:01.44] doesn't cost much
[13:02.24] extra effort so we'll just do that okay
[13:05.20] i think we're about ready
[13:06.56] to make our first attempt at a
[13:09.28] definition of what is a manifold
[13:15.92] definition right so an
[13:19.12] n-dimensional
[13:25.84] c infinity so there's this notion of
[13:28.48] smoothness there already
[13:30.72] real manifold
[13:34.96] and what is it it's a set
[13:39.68] so i'm at least assuming you're familiar
[13:41.92] with the notion of
[13:43.20] set theory no basic questions from set
[13:45.84] theory
[13:46.80] together with a collection
[13:52.56] we'll call them o alpha of subsets
[14:01.68] satisfying
[14:05.84] a couple of requirements there's a
[14:08.40] zeroth requirement that i'll refer
[14:10.00] come back to in a minute one
[14:13.76] the set
[14:17.20] z o alpha covers m
[14:22.24] so m is there's all these subsets o
[14:25.60] alpha lying around and m
[14:28.72] is covered by them what does that mean
[14:30.40] it means if you stick them all together
[14:34.64] you get m another way of saying is it
[14:38.64] it's saying this is for every point
[14:42.08] p inside m
[14:45.60] there exists at least one alpha
[14:52.48] such that p lies in o alpha
[14:57.20] so although i haven't uh
[15:02.64] although i'm urging you not to think of
[15:04.64] manifolds as embedded in some bigger
[15:06.64] space of course
[15:07.60] when i draw pictures that's exactly what
[15:09.28] i'm going to do
[15:10.80] you just have to try and forget that
[15:13.36] there's this
[15:14.48] implied embedding space in all my
[15:16.32] pictures so i like you know this is the
[15:18.72] picture i have mentally when i'm talking
[15:20.40] about
[15:21.20] uh this first condition so here m is
[15:23.84] somehow this
[15:24.80] curvy surface and it's covered by these
[15:28.32] sets
[15:28.80] o alpha and every point
[15:32.40] lies in one o alpha or another
[15:35.76] so i'm just you imagine partitioning up
[15:38.24] your space
[15:38.88] m you'll set m into little pieces and
[15:42.72] there's at least one of these o alphas
[15:45.04] over the top of any point
[15:50.88] now that's not all
[15:55.36] so for each alpha
[15:59.44] there is a one to one
[16:03.04] and onto map
[16:07.04] psi alpha that goes from this
[16:10.40] o alpha o alpha set to another set u
[16:13.12] alpha
[16:14.80] where this u alpha is now a subset of of
[16:17.52] r
[16:17.92] n right now here n makes an appearance
[16:20.80] so notice that in the
[16:22.00] first part of this definition the
[16:23.76] dimension uh
[16:25.20] doesn't even make an appearance so m is
[16:27.12] just a set
[16:28.24] covered by some subsets in the second
[16:31.28] part the dimension now makes an
[16:32.64] appearance
[16:34.00] and uh and now the picture we we have in
[16:37.12] mind is that you know here's
[16:38.40] m is this curvy presumably curvy surface
[16:41.68] is here's these o alphas i'll just draw
[16:45.20] one o alpha
[16:48.40] this is m and now we're saying there
[16:51.20] exists
[16:53.28] a map which is one to one and onto
[16:59.28] from each of these o alphas
[17:03.68] onto sets u alpha of our
[17:06.96] more familiar rn euclidean space
[17:15.92] that's what the second part of the
[17:16.96] definition says so
[17:19.20] what you're really meant to think of is
[17:20.56] one to one and onto means kind of equal
[17:24.40] and we're really saying that each part
[17:26.80] of this
[17:28.00] curvy surface m this manifold m is
[17:30.80] identified with pieces
[17:32.56] of euclidean space so you're really
[17:34.32] meant to think of a manifold as
[17:36.56] as being uh built up or sewn to
[17:40.80] of pieces of rn that are sewn together
[17:43.84] stuck together
[17:48.16] now the third part of the definition
[17:50.32] concerns
[17:51.20] the sewing or the gluing of these these
[17:53.84] pieces
[17:56.96] so if any of these two if any of these
[17:59.36] pieces o alpha
[18:00.64] and a beta overlap right if they
[18:03.92] they have common points
[18:10.88] so if you take the intersection and you
[18:13.52] don't get the empty set
[18:16.80] then you can define
[18:20.16] a new map
[18:24.24] and this new map is composed of this psi
[18:26.32] beta
[18:27.44] and the psi alpha inverse so if the
[18:29.04] inverse exists because it's one to one
[18:30.48] and on two
[18:33.60] which acts via
[18:37.60] following so you can build this map c
[18:40.16] psi beta composed with psi
[18:42.00] alpha inverse and where does it go from
[18:45.20] into well it goes
[18:46.32] from the image of psi
[18:49.52] alpha intersect of psi
[18:52.96] alpha o o alpha o beta
[18:57.12] and it goes to psi beta o
[19:00.24] alpha intersect o beta i'll draw a
[19:03.44] picture in one moment to illustrate
[19:05.44] what is going on here and these are both
[19:07.44] subsets of
[19:08.48] u beta so i've just drawn the subset
[19:11.12] symbol vertically
[19:15.20] this is not an intersection this is a
[19:18.56] subset of
[19:22.56] and before i draw the picture so
[19:25.60] we've defined this this this map
[19:28.64] psi alpha inverse compose side beta
[19:32.40] and uh if any of these two patches of an
[19:35.84] o beta overlap
[19:37.28] then this map that we've just defined is
[19:39.68] not any old map
[19:41.20] it is a c infinity map so it's smooth
[19:44.08] infinitely number of
[19:45.60] infinitely differentiable
[19:49.52] so in short the definition says that
[19:51.60] that map is c infinity
[19:53.92] now here's a picture to illustrate this
[19:56.16] situation
[19:58.16] so here's our surface m
[20:06.08] here's now the case where we have two o
[20:09.28] betas
[20:11.12] o alphas and o betas the o alpha
[20:14.72] o beta they intersect somewhere
[20:18.48] all right this blue patch here
[20:22.72] and now thanks to part
[20:26.08] two of our definition we know there
[20:28.96] exists
[20:31.92] a uh maps
[20:34.96] psi alpha from o alpha to u alpha inside
[20:39.76] rn
[20:43.12] and under this map we can also identify
[20:47.12] the part
[20:49.44] of the intersection there so there it is
[20:52.40] there is that
[20:53.20] that's part from part two of the
[20:54.56] definition but there's also another map
[20:56.88] psi beta that takes
[21:00.48] o beta to some subset of rn
[21:04.32] it's not important that u alpha contains
[21:06.64] the origin or doesn't contain the origin
[21:08.48] we're not thinking
[21:09.60] the origin plays no role in the
[21:11.12] definition of manifold here
[21:14.48] and under that map the
[21:18.08] part of the intersection of oauth and
[21:19.52] obedience i colored in blue
[21:22.64] so part two of the definition already
[21:24.88] allows us to draw this part of the
[21:26.40] figure
[21:27.36] you have this curvy surface two sets
[21:28.96] they intersect you have these sciaticas
[21:30.64] and side betas you know they exist at
[21:32.24] one to one and onto
[21:33.60] but now you can also form a new map
[21:37.60] and this new map is psi beta composed
[21:40.96] with psi
[21:41.44] alpha inverse so imagine you have a
[21:44.16] point here
[21:44.96] in in this set u alpha sorry u beta
[21:49.12] so you have a point inside u beta you
[21:51.28] can always
[21:52.32] here it is let's call it i've drawn the
[21:54.16] point red
[21:55.68] you you can form the function psi beta
[21:58.48] inverse that just sort of goes the
[21:59.92] opposite direction
[22:01.04] to find out where that point oops of
[22:03.92] course i drew it wrong
[22:06.88] we want to have this point in the
[22:08.00] intersection of these two sets i mean
[22:09.44] what i said was right but whatever we
[22:10.96] want them in the intersection
[22:12.16] so suppose you have a point p in the
[22:13.92] intersection of
[22:16.48] o o alpha and o beta you can form the
[22:19.76] function psi beta inverse
[22:22.56] here it is because psi beta is one to
[22:24.88] one on two there is an inverse
[22:26.96] and now you look oh that point p that
[22:30.00] that
[22:32.96] that point p lying you know i don't know
[22:34.88] i'll do things a little differently i'll
[22:36.16] call this psi beta p
[22:37.60] down here just because later
[22:41.76] we'll want to do things that way so the
[22:43.68] red point side beta p
[22:44.96] has a pre image p inside the original
[22:47.68] manifold m
[22:48.88] ah but that belongs also to o alpha so
[22:50.80] we're perfectly within our rights
[22:52.48] to form
[22:54.67] [Music]
[22:57.60] the map psi alpha
[23:02.00] to apply the map site alpha to that
[23:03.76] point p
[23:08.48] and so we can draw maps going in both
[23:10.72] directions here i've done it in the
[23:12.24] reverse
[23:12.80] order but we could or equally will have
[23:15.28] told the story another way right there
[23:16.80] is
[23:17.12] suppose p is a point in the intersection
[23:21.36] of o l for an o beta
[23:25.04] then you can
[23:29.36] find its image in o alpha which we've
[23:31.52] called psi alpha p
[23:32.64] here that little that little
[23:36.08] cryptic symbol is psi alpha p that's a
[23:39.44] point inside rn
[23:41.68] and then you you could follow these
[23:43.28] arrows a different way you could apply
[23:44.88] to
[23:45.44] this point the map psi alpha inverse
[23:49.44] to get the point p and then you could
[23:50.96] apply the map psi beta
[23:53.68] to find the image in rn if you did that
[23:56.72] you will have just
[23:58.96] formed a map psi alpha inverse psi beta
[24:02.24] that goes
[24:02.80] between these sets u alpha and u beta
[24:06.48] now these maps go both ways right it's
[24:08.72] important to
[24:09.68] to to emphasize that
[24:15.04] now that you form that map you can't
[24:17.92] call it a manifold unless that map is
[24:19.68] smooth
[24:20.16] it means that all derivatives exist and
[24:22.24] are continuous
[24:33.92] there's a zeroth condition that i've
[24:36.00] made reference to already in this video
[24:38.88] the zeroth condition comes from general
[24:41.68] topology
[24:44.84] and is not really necessary
[24:50.32] to talk about general relativity
[24:54.24] it's quite sufficient to to use your
[24:56.24] physical intuition
[24:57.52] to say that m is sufficiently nice and
[25:00.16] since the number of examples that we
[25:01.52] really consider in this course is
[25:03.12] not completely um
[25:06.40] is not an uncountable list of horrible
[25:08.32] beasts but really a small
[25:10.80] list of of manifolds with
[25:14.48] quite a lot of good extra structure
[25:19.04] we don't really worry about the zeroth
[25:20.64] condition in this course but um
[25:22.48] in an addendum to this video i will
[25:24.40] certainly uh
[25:25.52] i'll spend a couple more words on the
[25:27.76] definition
[25:28.64] of of the of the mathematical definition
[25:31.84] of a manifold
[25:32.64] just if you're interested in those
[25:33.84] details so the zeroth condition
[25:36.00] is that m is a topological space
[25:40.80] which is um halsdorf and paracompact
[25:52.48] and that these maps
[25:55.60] site alpha homeomorphisms
[26:01.12] you know i'll do it in another way
[26:03.68] didn't leave enough space
[26:04.96] i'll put some space in here
[26:17.60] it worked it doesn't always work
[26:22.96] and psi alpha are homeomorphisms
[26:30.16] look if you know about poinsett topology
[26:32.24] in general topology then this will
[26:33.68] probably make you happy
[26:35.12] if you don't then don't worry about it
[26:36.72] in this course this is not going to be
[26:40.24] crucial
[26:43.68] for your understanding of general
[26:46.80] relativity in any way shape or form
[26:49.36] this is really stuff for the
[26:52.80] mathematically minded
[26:58.40] and as i said the actual examples that
[27:01.04] feature
[27:01.52] prominently in general relativity uh
[27:04.16] have some
[27:04.96] additional structure that we don't have
[27:06.16] to worry about this
[27:08.16] this axiom
[27:11.76] now these maps and sets and so on that
[27:14.32] we use to define
[27:15.44] a manifold they have names
[27:20.88] you've got to call them something and we
[27:22.32] give them the following names um
[27:25.68] are called what do we call them well if
[27:27.60] you're a mathematician you're
[27:28.80] most likely to call these maps say offer
[27:32.84] charts
[27:36.40] i tend to enjoy calling them charts as
[27:38.64] well
[27:39.60] or our coordinate systems
[27:47.20] that's probably the terminology that
[27:49.44] might feature more
[27:50.48] feet more prominently in physics
[27:55.60] and uh
[27:59.44] so i probably will call them
[28:02.56] interchangeably charts or coordinate
[28:04.24] systems throughout this course
[28:08.24] now the definition it's sort of
[28:10.08] important to say now
[28:11.76] that the definition so far
[28:15.60] like we're not quite done with calling
[28:17.68] this a manifold yet
[28:19.84] the definition so far depends on
[28:23.52] our choice of o alpha and beta
[28:30.40] oh alpha sorry it's psi alpha
[28:33.60] meaning and i mean is in the following
[28:35.20] sense
[28:36.88] so suppose you let's go back to our
[28:39.04] definition right the definition says
[28:41.36] that m is covered by a bunch of these
[28:44.16] things called o alpha
[28:47.84] and if we had chosen a different set of
[28:50.72] o alphas to cover m then we would have
[28:53.04] a different uh different manifold so
[28:56.64] you know an dimensional c infinity real
[28:59.52] manifold m is a set together with a
[29:01.04] collection of the subsets
[29:02.88] satisfying blah blah blah had we chosen
[29:05.44] a different bunch of subsets
[29:07.28] then we would formally have a different
[29:09.44] manifold
[29:10.40] however it's kind of obvious that um you
[29:13.28] know if we choose
[29:14.48] them in the the same way or as encoding
[29:17.52] the same information we have the same
[29:18.88] manifold
[29:19.76] so we've got to spend a little bit of
[29:21.12] time talking about this this
[29:23.28] this arbitrariness so the definition so
[29:25.92] far depends
[29:26.88] on the choice of o alpha and psi alphas
[29:31.44] and and what does that mean so if
[29:34.88] and to show you how absurd things are so
[29:37.44] if we add
[29:38.72] with the current definition as a new set
[29:42.24] just one extra new set p and a new chart
[29:49.28] psi prime let's call it then per
[29:52.08] definition we have a new manifold right
[29:53.76] it's
[29:54.24] even even um
[29:59.28] we have a new manifold well maybe we do
[30:01.20] right maybe we add a bit more on but we
[30:02.64] get a new it's a new manifold even if
[30:06.88] um p and psi contain no new information
[30:19.12] so that's a bit strange right you you
[30:21.20] therefore have it you know
[30:23.20] if you have a whole bunch of sets
[30:24.40] covering m and you add one that sort of
[30:26.96] says covers is covered by all the
[30:29.36] original sets
[30:30.48] and you don't actually change you add
[30:32.56] any information
[30:33.52] and it's a bit strange that you you have
[30:35.12] a totally new manifold different
[30:36.80] manifold
[30:37.84] so we don't like that it's a bit silly
[30:40.40] so
[30:40.96] uh to eliminate this right we don't like
[30:43.60] this arbitrariness
[30:49.12] because probably you're already
[30:52.00] wondering
[30:52.48] thinking of ways to eliminate this
[30:53.84] arbitrariness
[30:55.60] well here's here's one way to do it
[31:01.04] so we require
[31:05.44] that this covering
[31:09.92] in the definition of m
[31:13.84] and these charts all this family of
[31:16.84] charts
[31:20.16] is maximal
[31:25.76] so what does that mean it means all
[31:28.24] possible if it is possible to add a set
[31:30.56] o alpha in and the chart psi alpha in
[31:33.36] which is compatible with all the
[31:34.64] pre-existing ones then you have to add
[31:36.24] it in
[31:44.24] so all coordinate systems here i'm going
[31:46.24] to use this notation
[31:47.68] interchangeably coordinate systems
[31:49.60] charts whatever
[31:50.88] you'll get used to it
[31:54.96] compatible with
[31:58.00] two and 3 in our definition
[32:01.28] are required included
[32:07.44] so if you can add a chart you must add a
[32:10.32] chart
[32:11.36] and then only then do you have a
[32:13.44] manifold
[32:15.44] okay we we've got this big long
[32:17.28] mathematical definition
[32:20.00] can't do physics unless we have examples
[32:22.64] so let's get to some examples
[32:26.00] and of course you know definitions all
[32:27.92] very well but if you can't present a
[32:29.28] single
[32:30.24] example uh fulfilling the requirements
[32:33.04] of your definition there's a pretty
[32:34.00] stupid definition
[32:35.84] um here's a laundry list of our favorite
[32:39.68] examples
[32:40.56] in physics and pretty much in maths as
[32:42.80] well
[32:43.84] well the it better be right that our
[32:47.04] notion of a
[32:47.92] curved continuum contains the original
[32:51.20] uh notion from which we departed from
[32:53.76] namely space time itself
[32:56.00] rn is a trivial example right
[32:59.20] it better be an example otherwise we've
[33:00.96] messed up in coming up with our
[33:02.72] definition
[33:05.52] and it can be covered by one
[33:08.72] chart of course
[33:20.16] and what is that chart will just r in
[33:22.84] itself
[33:24.56] and then oh yeah with psi being the
[33:26.64] identity map
[33:30.64] now rn as a manifold
[33:33.76] is required to include all possible
[33:36.72] charts
[33:37.20] remember
[33:41.44] so as a euclidea as the thing that we
[33:43.60] call euclidean space
[33:46.08] it's okay to describe rn just as this
[33:48.48] set rn
[33:50.96] but if you want to call r in a manifold
[33:54.48] well you need to include per definition
[33:56.80] every cover
[33:57.52] every chart every coordinate system
[33:59.44] that's compatible with the pre-existing
[34:01.44] charts
[34:02.64] and therefore it has uncountably many
[34:09.12] many covers right because you know
[34:12.72] here's rn right i'm just drawing it as a
[34:14.40] square
[34:15.12] it's covered by the set o let's call the
[34:18.00] set o
[34:18.88] whatever one is just rn but it's also
[34:22.96] covered by these three sets suppose they
[34:26.72] go off to infinity so o2
[34:28.64] o3 and o4 so
[34:31.76] o2 is this yellow set here
[34:36.00] 4 is this blue set here that goes off to
[34:38.56] infinity saying
[34:39.84] you know 3 is this green set here it's
[34:42.00] also covered by those
[34:43.44] and as long as we set up our
[34:46.96] and e and and the chart
[34:53.60] what chart should we use for o2 well the
[34:55.76] identity again right
[34:57.68] um and so on 0304 and then you can add
[35:01.60] any way of covering rn
[35:04.72] with the corresponding identity chart
[35:07.44] that
[35:07.84] is a compatible
[35:11.28] coordinate system compatible chart so it
[35:14.16] must go
[35:14.72] in when you're thinking of rn as a
[35:16.88] manifold rn is just euclidean
[35:19.20] space as a set you've constructed that
[35:21.68] presumably in some part of your
[35:23.04] undergraduate degree
[35:24.32] but rn is a manner and you didn't bother
[35:26.48] with all these charts and identities and
[35:28.16] so on but when you want to
[35:30.08] talk about manifolds you have to have
[35:32.80] this extra baggage of charts and
[35:35.84] and coordinate systems around so you
[35:38.08] really have to allow that to be in
[35:40.40] as part of the definition and is
[35:43.60] required
[35:44.08] part of the definition so when you think
[35:45.44] of rn you really got to think of it as
[35:46.96] yes your friendly
[35:48.32] euclidean space are in but with all
[35:51.04] these sort of infinite ways of drawing
[35:52.64] coordinate systems on it
[35:54.40] included okay what's another example
[35:59.04] well space time itself is an example of
[36:03.12] a manifold
[36:04.08] we'll prove that well we'll realize it
[36:06.80] as a manifold presently
[36:10.96] it's space-time itself you
[36:14.40] in special relativity has a temporal
[36:16.16] axis and three spatial axes
[36:18.72] uh and we often distinguish the temporal
[36:22.00] axis by writing
[36:23.60] space time as like r superscript one
[36:25.84] comma three just to emphasize that one
[36:27.68] of them is time one not
[36:29.44] but as as a set and even as a manifold
[36:33.44] manifold but not uh different
[36:36.96] without metric these sets are just
[36:39.28] equivalent to r4 which is already a
[36:41.04] manifold
[36:45.04] and all this lorenzian stuff and so on
[36:52.40] that comes later right that's as a
[36:54.88] manifold
[36:57.12] it it it is you can identify it as a
[36:59.76] subset
[37:00.40] uh that charts with subsets of our force
[37:02.16] it's a manifold of a four-dimensional
[37:04.32] manifold
[37:05.52] all this temporal stuff and lorenz
[37:08.56] structure and blah blah blah
[37:10.08] that comes later like you add that on
[37:16.56] so manifold's a pretty abstract concept
[37:18.88] they cover a lot of
[37:20.00] different examples okay
[37:23.68] the next most important example is the
[37:25.76] sphere
[37:27.60] sn which is you know
[37:32.24] embedded
[37:35.52] in n plus one dimensions yeah i know
[37:37.92] we're not going to do things with
[37:38.96] embedded manifolds
[37:40.48] um but we are of course
[37:43.68] embedded manifolds are one of the best
[37:45.28] examples of manifolds
[37:47.68] but we want to do we want to allow our
[37:49.68] structures to be intrinsically defined
[37:51.44] without reference to that embedding
[37:52.88] space but here we go we're going to
[37:54.00] define the sphere sn anyway
[37:56.32] as an embedded manifold
[38:01.28] how do you define the n sphere well it's
[38:04.08] a subset of n
[38:05.36] r n plus one and the subset is defined
[38:09.28] by all those points which have unit
[38:10.88] length
[38:12.00] whatever unit radius
[38:15.52] unit length inside rn plus one
[38:21.60] now that doesn't make it a manifold just
[38:23.36] writing it as a subset of rn plus one
[38:25.44] that certainly does not make it a
[38:26.64] manifold
[38:27.44] at the moment i haven't presented to you
[38:29.12] any way of covering this
[38:30.48] set i don't know what the coordinate
[38:31.92] systems are and so on so we have to
[38:34.08] introduce
[38:34.96] that structure right
[38:39.28] before we're allowed to call this a
[38:40.72] manifold and so
[38:42.56] we are going to introduce well a bunch
[38:45.68] of charts
[38:48.80] and then leave a lot of this to the
[38:50.00] exercise
[38:52.00] for you to confirm so let's define the
[38:55.20] following
[38:57.60] n plus one
[39:01.36] two n plus one sits
[39:11.44] so what you do is you take the nth or
[39:13.44] the alpha coordinate
[39:15.68] you take all the points inside the
[39:17.12] sphere where the alpha coordinate bigger
[39:18.56] than zero
[39:19.20] or less than zero and you call those two
[39:20.96] sets o alpha plus or no alpha minus
[39:26.24] okay that these sets cover
[39:29.84] so how many of these sets are there well
[39:32.16] there are
[39:35.04] two n plus one such sets
[39:38.08] all right you got the upper hemisphere
[39:40.00] upper alpha hemisphere the lower alpha
[39:42.16] hemisphere
[39:44.96] and how many hemispheres do you have
[39:46.32] well you have n plus one coordinate axes
[39:48.32] so you have two times n plus one such
[39:50.08] sets
[39:50.88] and they certainly cover
[39:55.12] sn like every point features and loads
[39:58.96] of these these hemispherical sets
[40:03.44] now uh great that's the first part
[40:06.56] of the definition of a manifold that you
[40:08.40] need a whole bunch of sets that cover it
[40:11.68] but that's not sufficient right we need
[40:13.52] more than the coordinate hemispheres
[40:15.44] to describe to give endow this set with
[40:17.76] the structure of a manifold
[40:19.36] we need also the
[40:22.72] the charts or coordinates systems
[40:25.28] themselves
[40:28.72] and these are specified by maps from
[40:30.96] these subsets
[40:34.00] to euclidean space so we define the
[40:36.84] corresponding
[40:39.04] charts psi alpha plus which goes from o
[40:41.76] alpha plus
[40:43.04] to rn and psi alpha minus that goes from
[40:46.80] of
[40:47.20] a minus to rn we define them
[40:51.09] [Music]
[40:55.44] via the following definition
[40:58.80] just take the coordinates
[41:03.44] the points in the set ul o alpha
[41:07.60] and delete delete
[41:10.96] the alpha coordinate
[41:26.56] and what you get at the end is an
[41:27.84] element of our n is really crucial right
[41:29.92] you start with points
[41:31.28] defined with respect to this weird
[41:32.96] embedding space rn plus one
[41:34.80] and then the coordinate charts delete
[41:36.96] the alpha coordinate
[41:38.56] they're vec they're away and then uh we
[41:41.36] end up with a vector of
[41:42.80] n numbers which is a naturally element
[41:44.72] of r n
[41:46.40] and that's how we define the charts or
[41:50.00] coordinate systems corresponding to
[41:51.28] these o alpha sets
[41:53.52] now we've done we've presented enough
[41:56.32] information
[41:57.44] to get the whole manifold so you'll have
[42:00.32] noticed
[42:00.88] in these previous examples we really
[42:02.56] define the manifold
[42:04.48] by specifying enough sets to cover the
[42:06.48] manifold
[42:07.60] and their corresponding charts and then
[42:09.20] we just say throw in all the rest that
[42:11.04] are compatible
[42:12.08] and that's generally speaking how we'll
[42:13.52] define manifolds
[42:15.44] in general for the rest of this course
[42:19.04] we'll just specify
[42:20.24] enough covering sets to cover the
[42:22.24] manifold we won't specify all the
[42:23.84] possible compatible ones those you
[42:26.24] just automatically
[42:29.44] add in by requiring that they are
[42:33.92] that that in the def in your example
[42:36.40] that all
[42:37.04] possible charts compatible the ones you
[42:38.64] already presented are already
[42:40.32] automatically included
[42:42.08] now there's a special case of sn it's
[42:44.80] called
[42:45.36] s2 this is familiar to you i hope right
[42:48.64] what is it this is the the three
[42:50.08] dimension the two-dimensional sphere
[42:52.32] embedded in three-dimensional space
[42:55.92] this is what it looks like
[42:59.68] so you've got three coordinate axes now
[43:01.52] in the case of n equals three
[43:03.84] and the three dimensional sphere is well
[43:05.92] you know what the
[43:07.52] sorry the two sphere is you know what it
[43:09.76] looks like right
[43:11.20] so it's the sphere embedded in r3
[43:15.92] and we can just look at some examples of
[43:17.92] these coordinate axes
[43:19.52] so that's these hemisphere
[43:23.92] sets hemispherical covering sets o alpha
[43:26.88] so let's take a look at ox
[43:28.32] plus minus so ox
[43:32.08] plus minus is the set of all points
[43:35.12] where
[43:35.52] x coordinate was to look at o ox plus
[43:43.92] i just want to illustrate ox plus to you
[43:46.48] so if you remember
[43:47.84] o alpha plus is all the set of all the
[43:49.68] points in the
[43:50.88] embedding space where the alpha
[43:52.64] coordinate is greater than zero
[43:54.64] here the x-axis sort of points out of
[43:56.48] the screen so to speak
[43:57.68] an ox plus is the set of all those
[43:59.92] points on the front half
[44:01.28] therefore of the sphere so it's this
[44:04.08] stuff here
[44:05.04] but not the back half
[44:08.48] and uh let's draw another one let's try
[44:11.36] uh
[44:12.40] a y minus so here's the
[44:17.84] a circle around the hem
[44:22.24] the y equals zero uh equator of the
[44:24.96] sphere
[44:25.84] and o y minus is the set of all those
[44:28.40] points
[44:29.28] underneath this
[44:33.60] coordinate axis there
[44:40.24] so the intersection of o x plus and o y
[44:43.44] minus is relevant
[44:44.64] in the second is at like a quarter of
[44:47.44] the surface
[44:48.48] of the sphere here and you can go
[44:50.96] through all the possibilities here there
[44:52.80] are
[44:54.08] there's six possible coordinate
[44:58.00] uh charts that we've we specified s2
[45:01.04] with respect to um
[45:06.48] so look at now let's take a look at the
[45:10.32] transition functions the circle
[45:11.68] transition functions because we don't
[45:13.68] yet have a sphere right
[45:15.12] we don't yet have a manifold i've
[45:16.56] specified the the sets o alpha the
[45:19.12] chart site alpha but you're not allowed
[45:21.20] to call it a smooth real manifold unless
[45:22.80] these transit circle transition
[45:24.24] functions
[45:26.40] are all c infinity or smooth functions
[45:31.04] so yep let's take a look at this one
[45:34.96] so for example you could look at the the
[45:37.60] map
[45:38.16] the chart that goes from uh
[45:41.52] o alpha plus to o y minus and
[45:46.16] it's an exercise to show that
[45:49.44] this function is given precisely
[45:57.20] by this formula sorry when i said o
[45:59.36] alpha i should have said
[46:00.56] u alpha so this transition function
[46:12.48] goes from a subset of u alpha to
[46:15.60] a subset of u beta if we go back
[46:19.36] to the definition here we see that
[46:23.28] u alpha is mapped by this transition
[46:25.92] function to u beta
[46:30.24] and it's given in r2 precisely by the
[46:34.00] formula i've described
[46:35.60] and that's an exercise and indeed it's
[46:38.16] an exercise
[46:41.28] to find the rest
[46:44.40] of these transition functions
[46:53.20] and show
[46:57.36] they are all c infinity smooth functions
[47:04.08] okay so before we go on with uh
[47:07.36] building up manifolds and the theory of
[47:09.60] manifolds
[47:10.40] i just want to comment do we need all
[47:11.84] this manifold stuff really
[47:13.68] um you know i've sort of touched on this
[47:22.84] earlier
[47:29.04] but i want to amplify this point
[47:36.08] the answer is sort of no if you want to
[47:37.92] do basic general relativity
[47:39.52] uh you probably don't really need all
[47:41.36] this manifold stuff it will be
[47:42.96] sufficient to cover many of the basic
[47:44.96] examples of
[47:45.92] the basic solutions of einstein's field
[47:47.44] equations just with r4
[47:50.00] as a manifold um of course the geometry
[47:52.72] changes
[47:53.36] but the manifold itself is just r4
[47:55.68] underlying it
[47:57.04] however really when you want to discuss
[47:58.72] more interesting solutions to einstein's
[48:00.88] field equations
[48:02.24] cosmology non-trivial cosmologies and
[48:04.80] black holes
[48:06.00] it becomes necessary to consider more
[48:08.00] general manifolds
[48:09.28] you know ones with holes in them ones
[48:11.44] which are
[48:12.48] looks like donuts and so on and so forth
[48:15.12] and of course in quantum gravity you
[48:16.64] want to allow yourself to be able to sum
[48:18.16] over
[48:18.88] manifolds with non-trivial shapes
[48:22.64] so even though the answer is kind of
[48:24.24] like for basic general relativity the
[48:25.68] answer is no i would argue
[48:28.08] and we'll continue to argue that yes the
[48:30.56] answer is actually yes
[48:31.84] and i'll just give i'll write down two
[48:34.72] key examples just
[48:36.08] just within general relativity where you
[48:38.40] might want to be able to
[48:40.32] flexibly uh considered very quite
[48:43.44] different manifolds and that's given by
[48:45.28] the examples of
[48:46.48] cosmological solutions and black holes
[48:50.64] now it's all very well if you've got
[48:55.68] a couple of examples but when you want
[48:58.24] to build up a catalog
[48:59.52] of of non-trivial examples
[49:03.20] from a definition you typically want to
[49:05.60] find a way
[49:06.64] to combine your previous examples in
[49:09.36] interesting ways
[49:11.04] so that you know whatever mathematical
[49:13.52] object you're considering
[49:15.20] whatever physical theory you're
[49:16.32] considering if you've got a couple if
[49:18.16] you've got a nice definition and a
[49:19.44] couple of examples
[49:20.64] it only starts to get rich when you can
[49:22.16] prese you can build or furnish
[49:24.56] far more examples and for that you want
[49:26.80] to be able to build new examples and
[49:29.28] manifolds are no exception here so here
[49:32.16] we want to suppose that
[49:33.52] you know m and m prime
[49:36.64] are manifolds
[49:40.80] smooth real manifolds of dimension
[49:45.60] n and n prime
[49:48.96] respectively
[49:53.52] then we want to use these to build new
[49:56.48] examples and the simplest way to do this
[49:59.28] is by the so-called product construction
[50:07.04] the product space manifold
[50:15.44] and how do you do that well you're just
[50:17.04] going to take all the data that you
[50:18.48] that defines m and m prime separately as
[50:20.48] manifolds and some stick it together to
[50:22.32] get
[50:22.64] enough data to define a manifold that
[50:25.92] somehow matches your intuition of what
[50:27.84] the product should be
[50:31.52] so we have to build up some charts right
[50:35.84] so suppose we have the following charts
[50:40.80] coordinate systems defining separately
[50:43.76] or
[50:44.80] defining separately m and m prime
[50:54.16] then we want to be able to present
[50:55.68] enough charts for this thing that we
[50:57.60] call m cross m prime
[51:12.40] then so given these two charts
[51:16.16] we're going to define our chart for m
[51:19.60] cross m prime via
[51:29.20] psi we'll call it say alpha beta now
[51:32.32] and how does it work well it goes from a
[51:36.00] set called
[51:36.64] o alpha beta to a subset u
[51:39.68] alpha beta of our
[51:42.72] n plus rn prime times rn prime
[51:46.72] with oh alpha beta
[51:50.08] this has got to be a subset that covers
[51:52.24] our putative new
[51:53.60] product manifold here it is you just
[51:56.64] take
[51:57.36] the corresponding uh cover covering sets
[52:00.80] from the respective manifolds and u
[52:03.04] alpha beta
[52:04.00] is of course u alpha cross u beta prime
[52:07.76] and i haven't told you what these psi
[52:09.28] alpha betas are yet well i will now
[52:11.84] psi alpha beta acting on a point p in
[52:15.12] m and a p p prime and m prime
[52:18.56] is defined to be well you know just take
[52:23.68] the corresponding points
[52:32.88] in uh n
[52:37.36] plus n prime
[52:40.40] and this has got to hold for all pairs p
[52:42.96] p prime which are in this
[52:44.48] cartesian products at mm prime
[52:48.24] okay that's that that then presents
[52:50.96] enough
[52:51.60] enough sets to cover this new product
[52:54.08] set m cross m prime and then there's
[52:56.16] enough charts and they're all smooth
[52:58.32] that's all an exercise
[53:07.84] so you've got to show that the
[53:08.88] transition functions are smooth
[53:11.68] and then another exercise is to just
[53:15.20] you know we've been speaking about rn
[53:16.88] fairly uh
[53:18.64] loosely the whole time as a manifold but
[53:21.12] really i want you to realize now
[53:23.04] rn as this cartesian this products based
[53:26.84] construction
[53:34.24] now it's kind of interesting that with
[53:35.84] just these two examples effectively two
[53:38.00] examples of the sphere and rn you can
[53:39.84] realize quite a lot of interesting
[53:42.80] examples now with the product
[53:54.84] construction
[53:56.48] so just with these two families and
[53:59.36] their products
[54:10.48] one can build many
[54:15.68] interesting examples or relevant
[54:19.36] manifolds
[54:23.68] for general relativity lots of
[54:25.12] cosmological solutions can be realized
[54:27.04] as
[54:27.36] products of say r and circle so on and
[54:30.56] so forth
[54:31.60] or like you know an example that should
[54:34.56] be familiar to with you
[54:35.84] um is the taurus for example you know
[54:38.64] that's just this
[54:39.76] the circle across the circle etc
[54:42.96] etc you know then you can take the
[54:44.72] taurus product with the real numbers and
[54:51.20] now so far i've just defined to you what
[54:53.60] is this real smooth manifold of
[54:55.04] dimension in
[54:56.80] now we want to build up or want to endow
[54:59.76] this
[55:00.48] the class of all manifolds with a
[55:02.56] category structure we want to be able to
[55:03.92] talk about
[55:06.40] manifolds different manifolds winner to
[55:08.56] the same one or two different
[55:13.92] so our next goal is to endow the class
[55:17.12] of manifolds
[55:22.00] with a so-called category structure
[55:29.28] that's just fancy talk for saying that
[55:31.36] um we're gonna just
[55:34.56] define what it means to have a map
[55:36.08] between manifolds
[55:43.92] by describing morphisms morphisms is the
[55:46.32] fancy word for what does it mean
[55:48.00] to have maps between
[55:56.24] two manifolds okay let's define what we
[55:59.60] now mean by
[56:00.48] a map between two manifolds
[56:03.52] so let m and m prime
[56:07.28] be manifolds
[56:10.48] we're going to want to define what it
[56:11.84] means to have a map from m to m prime
[56:14.84] now
[56:17.92] and let psi alpha and psi beta prime be
[56:21.52] the
[56:22.32] coordinate charts
[56:26.96] here the the the underlying cover
[56:30.00] is now left implied
[56:34.16] so now we have a map a map of sets f
[56:37.36] between
[56:38.00] m and m prime remember m and m prime
[56:40.16] sets underlying it all they always says
[56:42.08] so we can have a map between them
[56:44.48] we have us is this really a map of
[56:47.04] manifolds
[56:48.08] well it is it's said to be
[56:51.20] a c infinity map smooth map
[56:57.52] between these two manifolds
[57:01.36] if for all alpha beta
[57:05.28] the following map of s
[57:08.40] of r n is smooth or c infinity
[57:24.64] so c infinity is synonymous with the
[57:26.88] word smooth
[57:32.16] okay so let's draw a picture
[57:33.76] representing the situation here
[57:35.68] so here's m here's
[57:40.72] m prime
[57:41.79] [Music]
[57:46.16] here's o alpha
[57:49.52] is o alpha prime
[57:58.16] remember corresponding to any subset
[58:01.84] or an element of our chart there's now
[58:03.92] i'll maps psi
[58:05.12] alpha to a map u alpha uh to set
[58:08.32] u alpha in r n
[58:12.48] u alpha prime here r n
[58:15.60] prime
[58:19.68] the dimensions are gonna be assumed the
[58:21.04] same by the way
[58:24.16] and now we can build the map
[58:27.76] i believe there's an inverse missing in
[58:29.36] my definition here
[58:44.80] so f is a map between
[58:47.92] m and m prime
[58:56.08] i believe i have a missing minus here
[59:04.16] so we now have we can form a map that
[59:06.72] goes between
[59:07.60] u alpha and u alpha prime
[59:11.20] by first
[59:14.64] mapping from u alpha to m via
[59:18.08] psi alpha inverse
[59:25.04] applying f and then mapping down from m
[59:27.92] prime
[59:28.64] to rn via psi beta prime
[59:32.96] and that induces this map here so first
[59:36.16] we go from
[59:37.12] rn back into m via psi alpha minus
[59:40.88] then we do the map f which is going
[59:42.40] between m and m prime by assumption
[59:44.32] and then we go from m prime to
[59:47.76] r n via psi beta prime
[59:51.04] so we get this red induced function
[59:55.04] and this
[59:58.96] map between manifolds is is said to be c
[60:02.16] infinity or smooth
[60:03.76] if this corresponding red function here
[60:06.24] is c infinity
[60:21.68] indeed
[60:27.44] good now
[60:30.88] we have a notion of a map between
[60:32.64] manifolds and now we can
[60:34.16] say what it means for two manifolds to
[60:37.60] be
[60:38.00] the same manifold
[60:52.80] so a manifold m and m prime are the same
[60:55.92] if there's a map between them
[60:57.52] but not just any map we need a kind of
[60:59.68] equals sign
[61:00.56] for manifolds and the thing
[61:04.08] that takes the place or the role of the
[61:06.08] equal sign is
[61:07.76] a so-called diffumorphism so if f going
[61:10.64] between m and m prime
[61:12.40] is it a c infinity
[61:15.68] one to one
[61:19.20] and onto map
[61:23.12] and
[61:26.80] if this function has a c infinity
[61:28.96] inverse so
[61:30.80] you can invert it and it has all the
[61:32.48] same
[61:34.80] and it's also smooth then we give this
[61:38.00] special function a name
[61:41.44] we call it a diffumorphism
[61:50.32] now the existence of a differeomorphism
[61:53.12] between two manifolds is really what we
[61:54.64] mean by them being
[61:55.52] the same manifold so
[62:00.16] if there exists a diffumorphism
[62:10.88] then we call the two manifolds
[62:18.84] diphyomorphic
[62:22.24] physics translation they're equal
[62:26.40] they're equal because you can
[62:29.84] show that the manifolds m
[62:32.96] and m prime have identical manifold
[62:36.48] structure
[62:44.80] right they have the same you can
[62:49.12] when you define them via charts they
[62:51.04] have the same you can identify all the
[62:52.80] charts you can identify all the
[62:54.32] the transition functions everything can
[62:56.16] be identified
[62:57.84] and set and therefore they're equal
[63:00.80] they're not only equals underlying sets
[63:02.40] to equal
[63:03.44] all this baggage on top of charts is
[63:05.20] equal as well
[63:07.20] now so far we've been talking about
[63:10.16] manifolds and manifolds are meant to
[63:12.00] supply us with a more general notion of
[63:14.16] what it means to be a continuer
[63:17.28] or an n-dimensional continuum
[63:20.80] now that's all very well and good but it
[63:23.12] turns out to do local physics we want
[63:25.52] more structure we want to we want to
[63:27.20] take we're quite greedy we want to take
[63:28.80] as much
[63:29.36] of the structure from familiar euclidean
[63:32.00] space and
[63:32.72] import it into our notion of a manifold
[63:37.28] and here it's important to comment that
[63:39.04] when you come up with a definition
[63:41.04] that's meant to generalize something it
[63:43.20] has to apply to more examples and so if
[63:45.36] something if a definition applies to
[63:46.80] more examples
[63:48.08] then you're going to lose uh resolution
[63:51.60] in the concepts so if there's a concept
[63:54.08] if there's a specific example you're
[63:55.68] trying to generalize to a more general
[63:57.12] class of things
[63:58.64] and that example has lots of structure
[64:00.48] then if you
[64:03.36] come up with a general definition that
[64:05.04] captures this example but a whole bunch
[64:06.40] of other examples
[64:07.52] then you will necessarily lose
[64:11.12] some of the structure that you're trying
[64:12.88] to generalize
[64:14.64] so you think about euclidean space for a
[64:17.20] moment you know
[64:17.92] you it's it's familiar to you euclidean
[64:20.24] space it's this flat
[64:21.92] collection of n-tuples so you could in
[64:24.64] space
[64:25.60] uh is a is a continuum but euclidean
[64:29.04] space is also is another thing it's a
[64:30.72] vector space
[64:32.16] euclidean space is a lot of things it's
[64:33.68] a group a mathematical group
[64:36.16] and all these these features that you
[64:38.80] euclidean space have
[64:40.24] may or may not survive uh in the
[64:43.36] manifold world when you try and
[64:45.04] generalize the notion of what a
[64:46.72] continuum is you may not be able to
[64:48.96] preserve the the structure of rn as a
[64:51.12] group
[64:51.44] indeed that turns out to be the case and
[64:53.20] you won't be able to preserve
[64:54.64] uh the vector space structure of of rn
[64:57.92] when you consider more general examples
[64:59.84] a more general manifold will not be a
[65:01.92] vector space
[65:03.36] but we want to preserve as much as we
[65:05.12] can particularly of this vector space
[65:07.04] structure because this helps us to do
[65:08.32] local physics without vectors
[65:10.24] we aren't able to do to define equations
[65:13.60] of motion for test particles in our
[65:15.28] space time so we want to preserve as
[65:16.80] much of the notion of say
[65:18.00] vector as possible
[65:24.08] so first comment is that euclidean
[65:27.28] and minkowski space
[65:36.16] has a natural vector space structure
[65:49.52] ie
[65:53.20] v which is rn
[65:56.24] is both a manifold and a vector space
[66:00.32] it certainly can be endowed with a
[66:02.08] manipulate structure
[66:05.04] but it also happens to be a vector space
[66:15.84] and it's it's a vector space globally
[66:18.64] right
[66:20.00] the whole space itself is the vector
[66:21.84] space
[66:25.12] now the next really important comment
[66:27.76] you know we've introduced the
[66:28.80] generalized notion of a continuum
[66:31.28] we don't get to keep vector space
[66:33.28] structure when we
[66:34.56] generalize our notions so for general
[66:37.84] manifolds
[66:41.44] it's not always the case that the
[66:42.96] manifold is a vector space
[66:47.60] so one loses and even if you look at the
[66:50.16] sphere
[66:50.96] you can see that this is the case one
[66:53.44] loses
[66:54.40] as an example of a manifold one loses
[66:58.00] the vector space structure
[67:02.40] it's too bad hey
[67:08.88] because there's no additive structure
[67:10.88] anymore
[67:13.84] yeah there's probably you can think of a
[67:16.00] perverse way to add items
[67:18.16] and add elements of the vector space but
[67:21.12] uh
[67:21.84] so maybe i should just say there's no
[67:23.44] natural
[67:25.52] additive structure that
[67:28.64] inherits or smoothly deforms the vector
[67:32.08] space structure of rn
[67:33.60] and so the example you know one example
[67:36.32] is
[67:36.80] is sn
[67:41.04] or even s2 right s2 is not a vector
[67:43.84] space as i said
[67:53.76] it is however possible to associate
[67:55.84] vector spaces
[67:57.36] to manifolds
[68:10.64] and that's something that's rather
[68:12.48] interesting about euclidean space
[68:28.16] so euclidean space is globally a vector
[68:30.88] space you can
[68:32.96] add two elements multiply them by
[68:34.96] scalars and so on
[68:36.64] but rn euclidean space is also if you
[68:40.08] if you like an infinite number of vector
[68:42.16] spaces with
[68:43.84] associated to each point in rn you can
[68:45.92] associate well
[68:47.04] rn right that sounds a bit strange but
[68:50.24] this
[68:50.64] example of sn i think better highlights
[68:52.88] what i mean
[68:54.00] or s2 so in s2
[68:57.12] the sphere the surface of the sphere or
[68:59.44] the two sphere
[69:02.72] we don't have a natural vector space
[69:05.28] structure left
[69:06.00] on s2 there's no way no natural way to
[69:08.80] add elements of s2
[69:11.76] and get a vector space structure but
[69:14.32] there is actually associated
[69:16.00] s2 or to every point in s2 a natural
[69:18.72] vector space
[69:21.44] and that's the tangent space so if you
[69:24.24] have a point p
[69:25.20] on s2 then we can associate
[69:28.24] to that point p the tangent space this
[69:31.28] is the
[69:33.20] two two-dimensional hyperplane that
[69:34.80] kisses the sphere at that point
[69:42.56] so this two-dimensional hyperplane also
[69:45.44] called tangent space at p
[69:47.04] is a vector space right even though s2
[69:49.20] is not a vector space we lost that
[69:50.64] structure
[69:51.36] we still locally if you zoom in s2 looks
[69:54.88] like r2 and therefore
[69:56.56] um and you can associate this this plane
[69:59.60] to it this tangent plane
[70:01.04] and this tangent plane most certainly is
[70:02.48] a vector space or a vector subspace of
[70:04.24] r3
[70:07.76] so that works when you have this okay
[70:09.60] this is a bit clumsy because i told you
[70:11.60] we don't want to do things with embedded
[70:12.80] manifolds we're going to do everything
[70:13.92] intrinsically we don't want to make
[70:15.20] reference to this embedding space
[70:17.20] so it's a bit clumsy it looks like it
[70:18.48] may even in fact depend on how you embed
[70:20.80] your manifold into r3
[70:24.88] so we so we have a problem right with
[70:27.20] this idea of associating to each point
[70:29.20] in a manifold
[70:29.92] vector space so what if
[70:34.40] we define things
[70:37.60] or how to define things intrinsically
[70:49.68] we don't want to make reference to this
[70:50.96] embedding space can we even do this
[70:55.04] exclamation mark question mark is it
[70:57.20] possible well of course the answer is
[70:58.48] yes i wouldn't ask the question if it
[70:59.92] wasn't possible
[71:02.96] and it's kind of an interesting round
[71:04.32] about way of doing things
[71:06.32] so what we do is we we first
[71:09.44] identify this tangents-based structure
[71:12.40] with some other vector space that you
[71:13.84] can define intrinsically and then
[71:15.84] we define the tangent space to be that
[71:18.24] that other space
[71:23.20] so we first identify the vector space of
[71:26.48] tangent vectors
[71:38.56] with another vector space
[71:42.72] namely the vector space
[71:45.92] of directional derivatives
[72:00.00] and then we don't define tangent space
[72:04.32] intrinsically we define directional
[72:06.24] derivatives intrinsically
[72:21.04] a lovely little puzzle when you're
[72:22.48] trying to build more general definitions
[72:25.04] you try and isolate aspects
[72:28.32] of your definition that capture notions
[72:32.24] and then you search around equivalent
[72:34.72] realizations of these notions until you
[72:36.64] find something that's transferable to
[72:38.16] your more general scenario and that's
[72:39.36] the case here
[72:40.88] we we you know when you think of a
[72:42.72] tangent vector probably you're thinking
[72:44.24] of it geometrically you think of the
[72:45.84] the the surface embedded in r n you
[72:48.32] think of the tangent vector is a little
[72:49.52] arrow that's stuck with its base on the
[72:51.52] surface the tangent to the surface
[72:54.24] and then the tangent space of such
[72:55.76] vectors is kind of easy to realize in
[72:57.36] your mind
[72:58.72] but that picture you can't draw when you
[73:00.24] don't we're not allowed to make
[73:01.36] reference to this embedding space so
[73:03.12] we we now limit our
[73:06.32] uh our thinking and we say okay we're
[73:09.92] not allowed to make reference to the
[73:11.36] embedding space anymore
[73:12.56] could we come up with an equivalent
[73:14.00] notion of a tangential vector and the
[73:15.76] idea is right to every tangent vector
[73:17.28] there's a one to one and onto map
[73:18.64] between tangent vectors and directional
[73:20.40] derivatives
[73:22.16] and amazingly directional derivative is
[73:24.88] a notion that you can define
[73:26.56] intrinsically so that's where we're
[73:30.24] going to end
[73:30.88] the video for today's lecture
[73:34.08] in today's lecture we introduced the
[73:35.92] notion of a smooth manifold
[73:37.76] as a way of generalizing the idea of a
[73:40.96] continuous or a four-dimensional
[73:43.92] continuous
[73:44.72] to a more from the euclidean space to a
[73:48.16] more general setting
[73:50.32] we also commence the discussion of
[73:53.68] tangent space of a smooth manifold
[73:57.52] thank you very much and i look forward
[73:59.52] to seeing you in the next video
[74:05.04] for those of you are sticking around i'm
[74:07.12] just going to spend a couple of minutes
[74:09.20] going diving a little deeper into the
[74:11.44] definition
[74:12.24] of a smooth manifold this material is
[74:15.44] not required for the course however you
[74:17.52] might be curious
[74:18.72] how the how to derive how to define a
[74:22.40] smooth manifold
[74:23.84] in a mathematically rigorous way with
[74:26.00] reference to some
[74:27.20] aspects from point set and general
[74:29.12] topology so that's the purpose of this
[74:31.52] additional
[74:32.32] hazardous terrain track of this video
[74:42.96] so now i'm going to present to you uh
[74:45.04] the formal mathematical definition
[74:47.04] of a smooth smooth manifold in its full
[74:49.44] completeness
[74:51.92] so really to do things properly you have
[74:54.84] to
[74:57.36] first introduce the notion of
[75:00.48] something called a locally euclidean
[75:05.12] space m
[75:08.72] so if you want to define a smooth
[75:09.92] manifold or a more general class of
[75:11.60] manifold
[75:12.40] we want to at least come up with a
[75:13.92] notion of something that you might call
[75:15.20] a local euclidean space now a local
[75:24.64] euclidean space
[75:25.60] m of dimension d what is it well it's a
[75:29.92] halsdorf topological space
[75:42.80] so you have to remember what that is you
[75:44.56] know to every point you can put an open
[75:46.24] set around to
[75:47.04] any pair of points that separates them
[75:49.84] health topological space
[75:51.36] m
[75:55.20] for which each point
[76:02.40] has a neighborhood
[76:12.40] homeomorphic
[76:17.20] continuous function continuous inverse
[76:19.52] to an open
[76:22.32] subset of rd okay so in building up the
[76:26.40] rigorous the fully rigorous mathematical
[76:28.40] definition of a smooth manifold or a
[76:30.32] manifold
[76:30.96] of class ck we need to have this
[76:33.92] underlying
[76:34.80] structure of of the local euclidean
[76:37.04] space first
[76:39.44] so following this route we are now able
[76:45.36] to commence the full definition of a
[76:48.16] differentiable
[76:49.52] smooth manifold by
[76:53.44] layering on additional structure on this
[76:55.60] definition
[76:59.68] so the next layer of structure that we
[77:01.04] add on is the notion of a differentiable
[77:02.96] structure
[77:08.32] calligraphic f so a differential
[77:10.40] structure differentiable structure f
[77:12.88] of class c ck
[77:19.20] where one is less than k is less than
[77:21.68] infinity
[77:22.40] less than equal to infinity
[77:29.44] on a locally euclidean space
[77:40.00] m what is it well this is this is the
[77:43.68] part
[77:44.56] of the definition which captures parts
[77:47.84] one and two of the definition i
[77:49.68] presented in the main lecture
[77:53.36] luckily clean space m is a collection of
[77:56.00] coordinate systems
[77:58.64] or charts
[78:03.76] o alpha psi alpha such that alpha is in
[78:07.84] some indexing set a
[78:10.16] such that
[78:13.20] well a these sets cover
[78:16.56] when you union over all these oa or
[78:19.28] alphas
[78:19.92] they cover m b these transition
[78:24.84] functions
[78:27.20] are ck
[78:34.24] or at least ck for all
[78:38.16] alpha beta in these indexing sets and c
[78:42.00] the collection f is maximum
[78:54.32] with respect to b
[78:58.24] and this is the structure that captures
[79:01.68] parts one and two of our definition
[79:05.04] presented in the main lecture and
[79:06.24] finally now we come to a d
[79:09.48] dimensional
[79:12.80] differentiable manifold
[79:25.52] of class c k
[79:29.44] and uh this notion can actually be
[79:32.48] beautifully generalized to quote a big
[79:37.76] a much larger class of structures so ck
[79:40.96] can be generalized
[79:44.88] to c infinity well that's essentially
[79:47.92] included
[79:48.64] in the definition already but complex
[79:50.32] structures
[79:52.40] etc there's lots of ways to generalize
[79:54.72] this notion of a different
[79:55.68] differentiable structure and therefore
[79:57.04] you get different things
[79:58.64] such as complex manifolds is a pair
[80:03.12] what is it it's a pair of a local
[80:04.80] euclidean space and a differentiable
[80:06.40] structure
[80:15.44] d dimensional second countable
[80:22.64] local euclidean
[80:30.84] space m together with a differentiable
[80:44.84] structure
[80:49.60] of class ck
[80:56.16] okay so that's the end of this
[80:58.64] additional
[80:59.60] hazardous terrain track of this video as
[81:02.08] i said
[81:02.64] at the commencement of this additional
[81:05.12] section this material is not required
[81:07.44] for this course it is only presented for
[81:09.52] those of you who are
[81:11.20] curious to see where these definitions
[81:13.36] lie in the context of rigorous
[81:14.88] mathematical definitions
[81:16.96] that's it for now thank you and goodbye
