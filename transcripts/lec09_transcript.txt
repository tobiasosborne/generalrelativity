[00:00.16] hello and welcome back to introduction
[00:01.84] to general relativity
[00:03.52] in today's lecture we're going to
[00:04.88] continue our discussion of derivative
[00:06.96] operators on manifold and parallel
[00:09.12] transport
[00:14.24] so suppose that we have a manifold
[00:20.16] m and a derivative operator
[00:28.84] delta
[00:32.64] so delta a is a derivative operator in
[00:35.92] the sense of the previous lecture
[00:42.00] so suppose we have such a setup
[00:46.72] then today i'm going to explain to you
[00:49.68] how to use
[00:50.32] a delta a derivative or delta operator
[00:53.20] to build a notion
[00:54.48] of a parallel a notion of parallel
[00:57.04] transport or
[00:58.08] equivalently a parallel transporter
[01:00.48] device
[01:01.60] that will allow us to identify tangent
[01:03.68] spaces at different points on the
[01:05.04] manifold
[01:06.16] so here's my cartoon for a manifold
[01:09.76] here's m here's a point p
[01:13.76] and here's a point q now
[01:17.84] suppose we have some vector at p in the
[01:20.48] tangent space
[01:24.72] so this there's this vector v a in the
[01:28.00] tangent space
[01:29.68] uh the point at the manifold at the
[01:31.76] point p
[01:33.20] and suppose we have some curve some
[01:36.24] sufficiently nice curve joining p and
[01:38.96] another point q
[01:41.76] then our goal today is to define the
[01:44.80] notion
[01:45.84] via delta a this derivative operator of
[01:48.64] a parallel transport operation so
[01:51.76] we want to design or construct or
[01:54.40] engineer a box
[01:55.68] u delta what does your delta do it takes
[01:58.72] a
[01:59.20] vector at the tangent space of p
[02:02.24] and it produces somehow a vector of the
[02:04.80] tangent space at q
[02:08.56] and uh how are we going to design this
[02:11.04] box given the data
[02:12.32] of this derivative operator delta a
[02:15.04] suppose
[02:15.52] that's at the moment just given to us
[02:19.12] well via the following definition
[02:25.28] so let c be a curve okay i called it
[02:28.88] gamma
[02:29.44] um let's call the curve c
[02:33.12] just realize it probably makes better
[02:35.44] call it c here you have to let c
[02:37.36] be a curve
[02:40.80] in the manifold m so this is the
[02:42.96] manifold m
[02:46.64] with a tangent
[02:50.08] vector t a so
[02:53.44] several lectures ago i introduced the
[02:55.52] notion of a tangent vector to a curve so
[02:57.68] given the data of a curve you can always
[02:59.04] define a tangent vector
[03:00.96] there it is there i've drawn it in red
[03:02.56] that's t a
[03:05.12] so you've got it so far the input data
[03:07.84] is just
[03:08.56] a curve c and from the curve you get
[03:11.84] automatically a tangent vector
[03:13.76] t a now a vector
[03:17.20] another vector has nothing to do with t
[03:19.20] a priori
[03:20.80] v a given
[03:24.48] at each point
[03:29.20] in the curve c so we're not demanding
[03:33.12] that v
[03:33.52] a is existing everywhere we don't demand
[03:35.28] that v a is a vector field we just
[03:37.44] demand that we have a vector
[03:39.52] at every point in the curve c this one
[03:41.68] dimensional
[03:42.96] sub manifold c so
[03:46.00] a vector v a given at each point
[03:49.12] in c is said
[03:52.48] to be and here comes the definition
[03:54.64] parallely
[03:58.84] transported
[04:02.16] along c
[04:05.84] if when you contr construct the
[04:08.96] following
[04:10.24] tensor it's always zero so that's our
[04:13.36] definition
[04:14.24] of what it means for a vector
[04:17.76] v a to be parallely transported along a
[04:20.88] curve
[04:23.52] it's a bit awkward to say it but that's
[04:24.96] the definition
[04:29.44] uh oh yeah for all points in the curve c
[04:35.04] so let's just pause for a moment to
[04:36.64] investigate this definition
[04:38.24] we have a curve drawn the curve there we
[04:40.96] have a vector
[04:42.08] v all the way along the curve so v a is
[04:45.04] defined
[04:46.00] all the way along the curve there it is
[04:48.88] there
[04:50.88] and
[04:54.48] it's not necessarily defined anywhere
[04:56.16] else we don't have to define va
[04:57.84] on any other point of the manifold it's
[04:59.52] only required to be defined
[05:01.12] on the curve and it could be just
[05:03.44] nothing else outside the curve
[05:05.44] now a vector va given at each point in
[05:08.40] the
[05:08.96] c it's said to be parallely transported
[05:11.92] along
[05:12.48] c if when you take the derivative
[05:16.08] in the direction of the tangent vector t
[05:18.48] a of the curve
[05:19.60] of the vector v you always get zero
[05:22.24] meaning that
[05:23.20] the vector doesn't change as you push it
[05:25.44] along the curve that's the picture you
[05:26.80] want to have in mind
[05:29.76] now uh we can immediately generalize
[05:32.08] this to to all tensor fields uh
[05:34.00] no tensor fields but tensor's defined on
[05:35.84] the curve
[05:37.28] so similarly
[05:41.52] so if you have a tensor now on the curve
[05:47.20] in abstract index notation
[05:52.32] so if you have a tensor along c
[05:56.40] uh then we call it
[06:00.56] we say that the tensor is parallely
[06:02.48] transported along c
[06:04.24] if well the natural generalization of
[06:06.96] the condition for vectors
[06:08.24] is just to do the same derivative
[06:10.80] directional derivative
[06:12.00] along the curve and demand that it's
[06:15.44] equal to zero
[06:19.68] and that these this definition
[06:22.24] constitutes our notion of parallel
[06:24.08] transport
[06:26.00] on a manifold
[06:31.52] so in the case where
[06:34.32] [Music]
[06:39.60] the derivative operator is given by some
[06:42.56] coordinate derivative
[06:48.00] we can express the parallel transport
[06:50.24] definition in a coordinate chart
[06:58.64] so in particular that coordinate chart
[07:01.20] defining
[07:13.84] so if you go to the coordinate chart
[07:15.36] that defines delta a
[07:17.36] and then you write out this first
[07:18.96] parallel transport condition
[07:21.04] in components then what do you get well
[07:24.48] the tangent vector to the curve is just
[07:26.32] the derivative of the
[07:27.52] of the coordinates of the curve with
[07:29.44] respect to the
[07:30.64] parameter specifying where you're along
[07:32.80] the curve
[07:34.16] the
[07:34.74] [Music]
[07:37.84] the derivative operator is the
[07:39.12] derivative operator
[07:42.24] and then we have
[07:47.12] the
[07:50.80] f1 connection but in the coordinate
[07:53.36] chart
[07:54.40] these gamma
[07:58.08] equation coefficients
[08:01.60] and then if we look at this first term
[08:03.20] here so this is the bit corresponding to
[08:10.84] ta
[08:12.72] and the second bit's the bit
[08:14.24] corresponding to
[08:19.76] delta a and the final part of the
[08:22.96] equation
[08:23.76] is the part of the
[08:27.52] depending on the c coefficients
[08:31.36] so if we know if we just put these two
[08:32.96] terms together we know that we just have
[08:34.72] the the derivative
[08:37.92] of the vector components with respect to
[08:41.36] t so if you just look at the green and
[08:42.88] the yellow highlighted terms
[08:44.40] you see that we can put them together
[08:45.92] and we end up with the following
[08:46.96] equation we
[08:47.68] just it's just the same as doing the
[08:49.12] derivative of the vector components v
[08:51.52] nu in this basis with respect to t the
[08:53.92] parameter
[08:54.64] specifying where you are on the curve
[08:58.32] and the same goes
[09:02.64] for the second part of the equation as
[09:06.84] well
[09:08.00] so we have in components of this this
[09:10.48] equation here
[09:11.76] which determines how a vector is
[09:13.76] parallel transported
[09:15.28] along a curve c but now in a coordinate
[09:19.20] basis
[09:20.00] particularly the coordinate base is
[09:21.36] defining the manifold uh
[09:23.04] defining the derivative operator delta
[09:28.00] i just want to emphasize that parallel
[09:29.76] transport this notion that we just
[09:31.44] introduced here
[09:32.88] only depends
[09:36.72] on va on the curve
[09:41.28] c we don't need
[09:44.64] that va is a vector field
[10:01.36] so this is a set of equations
[10:05.12] in a coordinate chart this
[10:09.92] yellow box star is actually a set of
[10:11.76] equations
[10:15.92] it's a set of non-linear
[10:20.48] ordinary differential equations
[10:25.52] and we can ask when does a solution
[10:27.36] exist is the solution unique
[10:29.36] and so on and the answer is
[10:33.04] it's a it's guaranteed at least for an
[10:36.16] interval
[10:36.72] of time t or parameter t
[10:41.52] and that that comes from general
[10:44.16] existence and uniqueness results
[10:46.56] in the theory of ordinary differential
[10:48.08] equations
[10:50.08] so if you're just happy to believe
[10:51.52] that's a that's a whole course by itself
[10:53.92] use it
[10:56.48] theory of ordinary differential not only
[10:58.08] ordinary differential equations
[11:01.92] and i'll just i assume that you'll be
[11:04.00] happy to believe me that there's a
[11:05.44] solution is guaranteed to exist
[11:15.52] so exist standard existence and
[11:17.04] uniqueness results you can look in the
[11:18.32] book of codington and levinson for
[11:19.92] example
[11:21.12] uh to to convince yourself of this
[11:25.12] guarantee that there's a solution of
[11:27.92] star
[11:28.96] 4 and here is a very interesting
[11:31.36] observation
[11:32.24] a given initial
[11:37.28] va so what we've
[11:41.12] what that already tells us this little
[11:42.72] bit of information that there's a
[11:44.24] solution to this equation for a given
[11:45.68] initial point is that once you've
[11:47.60] specified the vector va
[11:49.68] at the beginning of the curve that you
[11:52.48] want to parallel transport it along
[11:55.12] you've actually determined va entirely a
[11:57.12] length along the curve so
[11:58.72] it's not an arbitrary va that is
[12:02.08] defined arbitrary vector that's defined
[12:04.24] along the curve it's actually completely
[12:05.92] determined by the starting point
[12:12.16] so given uh two points p
[12:15.84] and q in the manifold
[12:20.72] and a curve gamma connecting them
[12:29.04] uh i'm going to use c in gamma to notate
[12:31.60] curves
[12:32.48] um we uh we can
[12:35.92] immediately infer from the the fact that
[12:37.52] there's a there exists
[12:39.60] a solution and the solution is unique to
[12:42.80] equation star
[12:43.84] we can immediately use that to build um
[12:47.68] the following parallel transporter we
[12:49.60] actually have now determined the
[12:51.28] parallel transporter
[13:02.00] u-gamma and such a parallel transporter
[13:05.84] you
[13:06.08] gamma is also known as a connection
[13:21.92] so the way it works is we we okay i'll
[13:25.04] draw another picture
[13:28.32] here's a manifold m
[13:32.72] here are two points p
[13:34.79] [Music]
[13:36.40] here's another point q
[13:39.60] here's a curve u gamma given in the
[13:42.24] manifold so note
[13:43.76] that the parallation of parallel
[13:45.84] transport depends on the curve
[13:48.48] here's a vector an initial vector v a
[13:51.60] at the point p
[13:54.64] now let's look at everything in a chart
[13:57.12] psi namely the chart defining the
[13:58.88] partial derivative of
[14:00.24] the coordinate derivative operator delta
[14:02.00] a
[14:06.56] here's two points p and q connected by a
[14:10.00] curve
[14:12.80] gamma now we're now in the coordinate
[14:14.84] system
[14:18.56] here's the vector vp
[14:23.04] and we define the vector vp
[14:26.32] to or the vector v mu now in this
[14:28.80] coordinate system to be parallel
[14:30.32] transported
[14:31.04] along you gamma if it obeys this
[14:33.28] equation
[14:34.96] star so not just any vector is allowed
[14:37.84] to be
[14:40.64] not just any vector along the curve
[14:42.40] gamma is defined to be parallel
[14:44.00] transported and namely only once solving
[14:48.48] uh the equation star
[14:52.08] so given a vector an initial vector v mu
[14:54.72] at the point p
[14:55.92] we we get a parallel transported vector
[14:59.68] v
[15:00.16] twiddle at point uh q
[15:06.80] and we could just simply say that u that
[15:08.72] that's defining
[15:10.00] the parallel transport of the v at the
[15:13.20] point p
[15:20.96] so that's the picture you should have in
[15:22.16] mind when talking about parallel
[15:24.84] transport
[15:29.12] so given just the structure of a
[15:30.56] manifold there's actually no
[15:32.56] preferred derivative operator we'll
[15:35.28] we'll take consider an example
[15:37.60] presently and uh that'll illustrate that
[15:40.48] i hope
[15:40.96] uh so this there's no real way around
[15:44.16] that
[15:44.56] um we just don't have enough data to
[15:47.68] completely specify
[15:48.88] a unique derivative operator
[15:52.40] the only way to uh proceed
[15:55.44] to satisfy ourselves that there is a
[15:58.08] scenario where there can be a unique
[15:59.92] derivative operator
[16:01.04] or preferred derivative operator is if
[16:03.28] we give in some additional data and the
[16:04.80] additional data that we need to supply
[16:06.08] is that of a metric
[16:21.04] so if we have the data of a metric gab
[16:27.12] we can make a canonical choice
[16:39.68] um of derivative operator delta a
[16:46.32] and why can we do that well there's some
[16:48.32] addition we got additional data now
[16:50.00] so the metric supplies us amongst other
[16:52.16] things with the notion of
[16:53.52] length so
[16:59.52] a metric also supplies us with a notion
[17:01.84] of an inner product
[17:06.32] between two tangent vectors v and w at
[17:08.96] the point p
[17:11.92] and indeed the inner product determines
[17:14.56] the length
[17:15.20] notion now
[17:20.72] what we can demand is
[17:24.16] that as we parallel transport one vector
[17:26.32] along a curve
[17:28.24] we can demand that its length stays the
[17:30.64] same
[17:31.28] right that's that's what's one thing
[17:32.88] that should really be correct right
[17:34.56] you what kind of notion of parallel
[17:36.48] transport would it be
[17:38.00] if as we push it along the curve the the
[17:40.08] tangent effect is getting shorter and
[17:41.28] longer
[17:42.64] uh that gets us some of the way towards
[17:44.88] determining a unique
[17:46.32] preferred or canonical choice of
[17:47.76] derivative operator but the
[17:49.76] additional data that we should really
[17:51.28] exploit to just settle this
[17:52.96] is to demand also the inner products
[17:54.56] between two tangent vectors
[17:56.16] are preserved as you push them along a
[17:58.80] parallel transport them along a curve
[18:01.60] after all if you're somehow moving
[18:03.12] vectors parallel to themselves
[18:04.96] parallel to themselves along a curve it
[18:07.84] shouldn't be that you're changing the
[18:09.20] angles between them as you're moving
[18:10.80] along the curve
[18:13.60] here's the picture so here's m we have a
[18:16.96] point p
[18:18.16] we have a point q we have a curve
[18:20.96] connecting them
[18:24.64] and now we're talking about a scenario
[18:26.72] where we've got two vectors
[18:30.00] at the point p v p and w
[18:33.28] at v and w let's see
[18:36.40] v and w now you would want right as you
[18:39.36] parallel transport along this curve that
[18:41.12] these two vectors
[18:42.00] have the same angle between them at each
[18:43.92] point on the curve
[18:51.44] and so on right all along the curve
[18:55.12] and that that turns out requiring
[19:02.56] that the inner product or the angle
[19:09.52] between arbitrary pairs of vectors in
[19:12.80] the tangent
[19:13.68] tangent space
[19:16.72] requiring that this inner product is
[19:18.16] preserved
[19:21.44] uh during parallel transport that's
[19:23.92] enough
[19:27.44] to determine a unique or canonical
[19:30.40] choice
[19:30.88] of derivative operator
[19:46.24] okay how does that work
[19:50.40] well we demand that the inner product
[19:52.56] doesn't change as we go along
[19:54.40] the the curve so as we parallel
[19:56.80] transport along the curve so
[19:58.72] the notion of parallel transport even
[20:00.32] works for scalar functions right
[20:06.08] gbc vbwc
[20:09.68] is a scalar function on m
[20:13.12] it's a nice smooth function on m
[20:16.32] and the notion of parallel transport is
[20:18.16] defined for all tensors
[20:19.44] and it's just them and we just demand
[20:21.12] that that scalar function
[20:23.12] doesn't change along the curve so we
[20:24.80] take two
[20:26.72] vectors uh v a w
[20:30.32] a in the tangent space of p we compute
[20:33.36] the inner product
[20:34.32] we parallel transport them and then we
[20:37.60] demand that the inner products between
[20:38.96] the parallel transported versions
[20:40.48] doesn't change
[20:42.08] so implicit here in this equation
[20:45.68] is that each of these two vectors is
[20:47.36] parallel transported as well right
[20:55.28] you know if we don't parallel transport
[20:56.80] v and w along the curves then we
[20:58.08] shouldn't demand that their inner
[20:59.12] products
[21:00.64] are invariant but suppose we have
[21:02.16] parallel transported v and w along the
[21:04.56] curve then the inner products ought to
[21:05.92] be the same right
[21:07.12] along the whole curve or not to change
[21:10.80] and now if you look at that expression
[21:12.40] here for the
[21:15.76] the change along the curve of the inner
[21:18.64] product
[21:19.20] we can actually start using the rules of
[21:20.88] derivative operators to compute this
[21:22.56] expression so we're going to use the
[21:23.92] leibniz property
[21:32.72] to expand out this this condition here
[21:39.44] so we apply the derivative operator to
[21:41.60] the first term in that expression
[21:44.16] which is the metric g
[21:47.44] b c and we leave
[21:50.56] v b and w c alone then we have to apply
[21:53.12] the derivative operator to the second
[21:55.04] term
[21:55.84] which is vb
[21:59.52] but then we leave wc alone and then we
[22:02.32] apply the derivative
[22:03.44] operator to the third term while leaving
[22:07.04] gbc
[22:07.84] and vb alone
[22:13.60] but by assumption right these two two
[22:16.72] vectors are parallel transported
[22:18.80] along the curve so those two terms
[22:20.56] vanish
[22:22.88] so this condition that the the vanishing
[22:25.52] of this
[22:26.80] inner product uh means
[22:30.32] that uh we are requiring that v
[22:34.24] c w c t a delta a
[22:37.44] g b c equals zero um
[22:41.68] we demand that this condition is true
[22:45.28] for all parallel transported v's for all
[22:48.48] power oops
[22:49.44] it should be a b shouldn't it
[22:53.76] for all parallel transported the vector
[22:56.08] fields v
[22:57.20] for all parallel transporter vector
[22:58.56] fields w and
[23:00.40] for all curves right
[23:03.44] joining um
[23:06.57] [Music]
[23:07.84] these two points and hence for all
[23:11.28] tangent vectors to the curves now the
[23:13.52] only way that can all be true
[23:16.40] is if separately
[23:19.60] delta a g b c is zero
[23:24.32] and uh that's an extra condition that
[23:26.72] the derivative operator has to satisfy
[23:38.32] so we've derived a condition on the
[23:40.24] metric sorry on the
[23:42.16] the derivative operator delta a in terms
[23:44.88] of the metrics so if you think that the
[23:46.56] metric is additional data
[23:48.40] on a manifold uh then
[23:51.68] and that there's this whole family of
[23:54.40] possible metrics that you could put on a
[23:56.00] manifold
[23:56.96] then you can see that there could be and
[23:58.56] there actually is an incompatibility
[24:00.56] between an arbitrary derivative operator
[24:02.48] delta a and an arbitrary metric gbc
[24:05.52] they the choice of derivative operators
[24:07.68] so it's really you've got to think that
[24:09.28] the derivative operator here
[24:11.52] delta a uh
[24:15.28] you know there's a
[24:18.32] family of delta a's
[24:24.32] which are constrained
[24:30.84] by uh this choice of a metric
[24:34.08] g b c
[24:37.28] so not even though there's an infinite
[24:39.36] number of derivative operators you can
[24:40.72] assign to a manifold or associated to a
[24:42.32] manifold
[24:42.88] m not every one is going to be allowed
[24:45.44] because
[24:46.24] they might end up not obeying this
[24:48.32] condition here
[24:49.28] this delta a g b c condition
[24:53.20] this or equation star star and now we're
[24:56.16] going to ask the question well
[24:58.32] what constraints does this equation
[25:00.16] place on the choice of derivative
[25:01.68] operator delta a remember
[25:03.36] once you've got a derivative operator
[25:04.64] delta a you can get another one just in
[25:06.16] terms of a tensor field of type
[25:07.84] two one so one two and so
[25:10.88] you you might think well maybe
[25:14.48] maybe there's still a plenty of choice
[25:16.56] of derivative operator
[25:18.48] uh and the answer of course is not um
[25:21.44] and it's
[25:22.48] even sort of surprising
[25:25.52] how little choice you actually have so
[25:28.64] suppose we've got a manifold and we've
[25:30.48] got a
[25:31.84] metric g a b then the following theorem
[25:35.36] tells us that
[25:36.40] not only is there not much choice in
[25:38.24] derivative operator that you can assign
[25:39.68] to a manifold in fact there's
[25:40.80] essentially a unique derivative operator
[25:47.84] that you can assign to your manifold
[25:49.60] then there exists
[25:51.04] a unique
[26:03.20] derivative operator delta a
[26:07.04] satisfying star star which is otherwise
[26:10.48] written as g delta a g b c equals zero
[26:13.92] and that's kind of amazing right you you
[26:16.40] know the
[26:16.96] the data of a metric is just enough to
[26:18.80] uniquely specify one derivative operator
[26:20.72] it doesn't over specify like
[26:22.48] you know star star could be too
[26:24.48] constraining right you could throw out
[26:26.48] all the derivative operators that are
[26:27.76] possible
[26:28.56] it could be under constraining no it's
[26:30.48] just right
[26:33.20] equation starts those just right for
[26:35.68] choosing a derivative operator
[26:38.40] so let's this theorem is actually
[26:41.36] relatively easy to prove
[26:43.20] it's an explicit computation and you get
[26:45.20] the
[26:46.56] an explicit formula for the derivative
[26:48.40] operator that satisfies
[26:50.56] this equation star star so suppose delta
[26:53.76] a twiddle
[26:55.04] is a derivative operator
[27:02.24] um and you know the example that will
[27:04.40] occupy us is delta a
[27:06.96] is the coordinate derivative delta a and
[27:09.04] then we impose
[27:10.80] star star and what does it say well it
[27:14.16] says
[27:14.48] zero is delta a g b
[27:18.84] c and
[27:21.12] that since that we are applying
[27:24.48] the derivative operator to a tensor of
[27:28.08] type zero two
[27:30.88] we have to use the definition of the
[27:32.24] action of delta a on
[27:34.40] tensors and when we do we
[27:37.52] we see that delta a applied to g b c
[27:40.72] is the same as delta a twiddle applied
[27:42.56] to g b c
[27:44.00] minus and now we have this these c
[27:46.00] coefficients here
[27:50.56] that we have to apply to each index
[27:52.56] separately of
[27:53.60] the tensor g
[27:58.32] and uh
[28:02.16] let's process that expression so the
[28:03.84] thing on the left is 0 is going to be
[28:05.44] equal to the thing on the right
[28:07.76] now let's take a look at the equation
[28:11.12] on the right and we're going to process
[28:13.76] this equation in various ways
[28:15.76] and then we're going to determine a
[28:17.04] condition on the c's
[28:20.32] well let's write out the equation on the
[28:22.80] right-hand side first the equation on
[28:24.24] the right-hand side
[28:26.08] rearranging things simply says that
[28:27.60] delta a twiddle gbc
[28:29.28] equals c c a b plus
[28:32.64] c b a c right because we've got the
[28:34.72] metric remember when
[28:35.84] raising and lowering here
[28:39.12] i'm just using the fact that when you
[28:41.68] contract
[28:42.88] oops when you contract the metric
[28:46.72] against the tensor that's the equivalent
[28:48.72] to lowering an index of the tensor
[28:50.88] that's
[28:51.28] in this abstract index notation is how
[28:52.96] we represent it
[28:54.56] and that's how we define the action so
[28:56.96] we can write
[28:58.48] the right hand side of that equation
[29:00.24] there rearrange things as just this
[29:01.84] equation here delta a total gbc equals
[29:04.08] c c a b plus big c b ac
[29:08.16] now this this equation okay it's very
[29:11.52] fine it's that's a
[29:12.56] that's an equation we're going to derive
[29:14.72] two further equations
[29:16.40] they're exactly the same equation i'm
[29:17.76] just using different indices here
[29:19.68] i'm going to relabel indices
[29:25.52] so to get to the second line i've
[29:28.16] replaced a with b
[29:31.36] and uh b goes to a right so every
[29:34.08] instance of b
[29:34.80] in the previous equations have been
[29:36.00] replaced with a and vice versa
[29:38.08] and there's actually a third equation we
[29:39.52] can write out and write more out but
[29:40.88] we're only going to write out these
[29:41.92] three
[29:43.20] these are just derived right there's no
[29:45.04] magic here it's the same equation just
[29:46.96] with different
[29:48.40] index labelings so in this
[29:51.52] second equation second derived equation
[29:54.88] or third equation been done here c
[29:56.72] has been replaced with b b has been
[29:58.88] replaced with a
[30:00.40] and a goes to c and now we've got three
[30:03.44] equations they're all true they're all
[30:04.80] just the same equation but written out
[30:06.24] in different ways
[30:07.28] and so we can do is add this one and
[30:08.80] subtract the second one
[30:10.80] a third one so we're going to take these
[30:14.24] three equations add the first two and
[30:15.92] then subtract from the
[30:16.96] that sum the third one well let's write
[30:19.92] it out what do we get
[30:21.20] so we get delta a twiddle gbc
[30:24.72] plus delta b twiddle g ac
[30:28.00] minus delta c twiddle g a b
[30:31.68] has got to equal the right hand side
[30:33.68] right summed and
[30:35.12] subtracted so we've got c c a b plus
[30:38.56] c b a c plus c c b a
[30:42.24] plus c a b c minus c b
[30:45.36] c a minus
[30:48.96] c acb so the right hand side is got six
[30:52.40] terms
[30:53.36] but now let's look at that and you know
[30:55.44] we did these index substitutions for a
[30:57.28] reason
[30:58.08] and the reason is is that this are going
[30:59.36] to be some cancellations and here they
[31:00.80] are right here's our first cancellation
[31:02.64] these two terms cancel out and also
[31:05.92] the a c b terms cancel out
[31:09.04] at least they should do i haven't made a
[31:10.64] mistake
[31:12.08] ah yeah abc and acb cancel out
[31:16.48] and the reason these cancel out is that
[31:18.08] remember the coefficients
[31:19.84] tends to c uh is symmetric in the
[31:23.52] the last two indices so c b a b c equals
[31:26.88] c
[31:27.60] a c b all right symmetric
[31:30.80] prove that and so these two terms cancel
[31:33.84] out as well
[31:34.48] and so we're actually left with the
[31:36.40] following equation
[31:40.48] and then using the fact that these
[31:41.76] things are symmetric we we can add these
[31:44.16] two terms together so we get 2
[31:46.00] c c a b on the right hand side
[31:50.64] we're almost there because remember the
[31:53.52] freedom here the freedom we have
[31:55.12] is in the choice of these c coefficients
[32:00.40] that's the freedom we have in redefining
[32:03.92] derivative operators and we see that
[32:06.00] that's already determined by the metric
[32:08.80] right on the left hand side and we just
[32:10.48] want to make that express that
[32:12.48] bit more precisely
[32:16.00] concretely so we contract
[32:19.36] both sides of this equation
[32:24.80] with the inverse of the metric now
[32:29.12] and we divide by two and then we're
[32:31.60] going to get our
[32:33.28] i'm going to take the left-hand side the
[32:34.56] left-hand side now contracted with gcd
[32:38.88] so this left-hand side gets down to here
[32:40.88] we divide both sides by two
[32:43.76] contract both sides with gcd
[32:58.48] and we have that the coefficients now
[33:01.52] when we just realize that when you
[33:02.96] contract remember when you contract a
[33:04.64] tensor with a metric
[33:10.16] or contract any multi-component object
[33:12.80] with a metric that's
[33:13.84] called raising and in the abstract index
[33:15.68] notation
[33:18.72] that's just uh represented by putting
[33:21.04] the index up
[33:23.12] and now we're done
[33:35.44] there is no choice
[33:48.64] well there's a unique choice of
[33:50.08] derivative operator
[33:53.20] so if you have one derivative operator
[33:55.12] then
[33:59.20] it's uniquely determined by
[34:02.88] the metric
[34:20.64] so thus
[34:27.60] gab determines
[34:32.56] delta a so from now on right we're going
[34:36.16] to assume
[34:38.08] pretty much for the rest of this course
[34:40.24] that we have a metric
[34:42.00] that we're
[34:46.40] associated to the manifold
[34:54.72] well let me put it this way from now on
[34:56.48] when we have a metric right
[35:00.40] then i will implicitly assume that delta
[35:03.20] a
[35:03.60] b is this operator
[35:19.28] now in the specific choice
[35:31.68] where delta a twiddle is the coordinate
[35:33.92] derivative with respect to a chart
[35:37.28] the following christopher symbols
[35:45.76] well they're given by the theorem right
[35:49.12] so
[35:53.92] the coefficient c here completely
[35:55.60] determined in the theorem we have delta
[35:57.52] a twiddle
[35:59.12] then just substituting in
[36:02.24] for delta a twiddle in the coordinate
[36:04.16] chart
[36:06.56] gives us
[36:09.76] the following equation
[36:13.60] well firstly let's just substitute the
[36:15.20] delta a twiddle
[36:23.12] and then in the coordinate chart
[36:34.08] determining the derivative operator
[36:36.32] delta a
[36:37.68] these symbols have the following
[36:40.88] representation so remember
[36:44.56] that in a coordinate chart the
[36:47.36] derivative
[36:48.96] coordinate derivative of a tensor has
[36:51.76] these components
[36:53.68] so for that x i have an x
[36:57.12] slightly expanded explanation of the
[36:58.96] action of the coordinate derivative
[37:01.36] in a coordinate base on my blog you can
[37:03.20] see an additional note that i added
[37:05.52] after the previous lecture the lecture
[37:08.80] notes for the previous lecture
[37:11.36] so these crystal symbols for the
[37:14.48] coordinate derivative with respect to a
[37:16.00] chart psi
[37:20.32] are given uniquely in terms of the
[37:22.08] metric
[37:24.72] now this has all been rather abstract so
[37:28.08] far
[37:28.48] i'm going to now explain how in terms of
[37:31.44] i'm going to apply this
[37:32.72] in terms of the very very simple example
[37:34.48] but this will already this example
[37:36.08] i think will already very clearly
[37:37.36] illustrate um
[37:39.12] all the factors um
[37:42.56] all these objects at play
[37:46.24] so we're going to focus on pretty much
[37:47.76] the simplest manifold that we have at
[37:49.20] our disposal
[37:50.40] namely the two-dimensional plane
[37:52.88] euclidean
[37:53.76] space
[37:57.68] and you're going to see how the
[37:58.80] derivative operator is uniquely
[38:00.96] determined
[38:02.40] so choose a chart
[38:05.68] psi
[38:11.20] furnishing the usual cartesian products
[38:13.84] a
[38:14.24] cartesian coordinate system
[38:30.80] with coordinates x y right
[38:34.32] so this is just ordinary two dimensional
[38:38.96] x y coordinates
[38:43.52] and we we're in the c we're in a
[38:45.28] coordinate chart where
[38:48.16] the coordinate chart is covers the whole
[38:50.16] manifold m
[38:51.44] and the coordinates are written x y
[38:56.24] so we're going to let v be a vector
[39:03.20] in this coordinate system
[39:11.52] so v equals the sum as mu
[39:14.56] goes over x or y v
[39:17.92] superscript mu and then we need the the
[39:19.76] basis vectors in this coordinate system
[39:21.60] which are these partial derivative
[39:22.80] operators at the point ps
[39:25.68] there's v
[39:32.56] now we choose
[39:35.92] delta a twiddle
[39:40.32] with respect to these cartesian
[39:43.04] coordinates
[39:49.92] now we'll see that we have really no
[39:51.28] choice in the
[39:56.08] and derivative operators in different
[39:57.92] coordinate systems
[39:59.92] so let's first of all work out parallel
[40:02.24] transport in this coordinate system
[40:08.08] well to do that we have to work out the
[40:09.60] parallel we have to work out how delta a
[40:12.16] twiddle acts
[40:14.64] on a vector
[40:18.64] so at the point p which has coordinates
[40:20.80] x y
[40:24.72] how is delta a twiddle v defined well
[40:27.36] it's the coordinate derivative with
[40:28.64] respect to this
[40:29.44] coordinate system so it's just d d x
[40:33.04] d d x new of v mu
[40:37.04] all at xy
[40:41.36] and demanding
[40:45.76] that uh
[40:49.04] this vector is parallel transported in
[40:50.88] this coordinate system according to that
[40:53.92] this derivative operator
[40:58.40] leads to the following condition on the
[41:00.16] components v mu
[41:02.08] namely that they're constant
[41:08.88] so if v is a tangent vector
[41:14.16] at p
[41:17.68] the parallel transported vector
[41:27.84] at q which we could denote u gamma
[41:30.88] v e p we could just denote that as bq
[41:34.16] twiddle so this is the parallel
[41:35.28] transporter vector
[41:36.48] according to this equation this parallel
[41:38.24] transport equation here
[41:41.04] uh what components does v twiddle q have
[41:51.28] so at the new point x prime y prime
[41:54.32] which is just the in this coordinate
[41:56.64] chart
[41:57.52] psi the image of psi of q under psi
[42:00.88] so the new components of this vector at
[42:03.60] the new point y
[42:04.88] after parallel transport is just the
[42:07.60] same as the components of the original
[42:09.44] coordinate so this is the point p
[42:13.12] this is the point q um
[42:16.40] and then
[42:19.52] that's the the curve gamma connecting p
[42:22.64] and q and then here's imposing the
[42:25.92] parallel transport condition on this
[42:27.44] derivative
[42:28.08] operator leads to this notion of
[42:30.32] parallel transport we can just maybe
[42:31.60] slide the vector around
[42:34.00] this is the usual notion of parallel
[42:35.60] transport in plat space
[42:50.88] now if we do all of this again in a
[42:52.72] different coordinate system we see that
[42:54.16] we have no choice
[42:55.92] in in the derivative operator
[42:59.20] in the new coordinate system in any new
[43:01.28] coordinate system the derivative
[43:02.40] operator is now completely determined
[43:10.00] so let's now go to another chart
[43:15.84] so you know you've got an infinite
[43:17.52] number of coordinate charts in
[43:19.28] in any manifold but let's just choose
[43:20.96] one that you're probably very familiar
[43:22.24] with and that is uh
[43:23.36] polar coordinates
[43:32.96] and let's see how i'm going to slowly
[43:35.76] derive
[43:37.36] all of the ingredients of the derivative
[43:39.44] operator in this neutral coordinate
[43:40.88] chart and we'll see that
[43:42.16] although a priori you could write down
[43:44.08] an infinite number of
[43:48.16] derivative operators there's really one
[43:49.76] that's uniquely determined by the metric
[43:53.04] i should have said
[43:57.68] that the
[44:01.04] i didn't write this out actually what i
[44:03.20] should have said up here
[44:04.32] is that in this coordinate the cartesian
[44:09.04] coordinate system the crystal symbols
[44:11.12] all vanish so i'll just put that in here
[44:16.48] as a little exercise you'll see it's not
[44:19.04] such a hard exercise
[44:28.08] so so we have a coordinate system what
[44:31.60] does the metric i didn't write out the
[44:32.88] metric right
[44:33.84] so the metric in this coordinate system
[44:36.08] is
[44:37.12] dx mu dx tensor dx mu
[44:40.96] or otherwise known as dx square tends to
[44:43.36] dx
[44:47.20] plus d y tends to d y
[44:51.20] and you can prove as an exercise
[44:59.36] that the crystal symbols in this
[45:02.64] coordinate system vanish
[45:12.88] so let's now do all these calculations
[45:14.72] again but with respect to polar
[45:16.84] coordinates
[45:18.64] so so in polar coordinates how they
[45:20.24] defined well
[45:21.92] something with cartesian coordinates x
[45:23.44] and y has polar coordinates r
[45:26.08] cos phi
[45:30.72] r sine phi
[45:35.92] now we want to uh
[45:39.76] we now need to transform the metric
[45:47.04] you know what does the metric look like
[45:48.40] in a new coordinate system
[45:50.88] how do we determine length in polar
[45:52.64] coordinates that's the other way of
[45:53.84] saying it well remember the g
[45:55.28] in the old coordinate system is d x
[45:57.76] tends to dx
[45:58.88] i mean i think i wrote something teeny
[46:01.04] bit wrong
[46:02.32] no no that's correct um so the metric in
[46:05.84] the old coordinate system is
[46:07.36] d x tends to d x plus d y tends to d
[46:10.80] y now we're going to go to the new
[46:13.44] coordinate
[46:14.00] system so to do that we have to note
[46:16.32] that
[46:17.28] dx is the same as partial dx dr
[46:23.36] big dr d d phi
[46:26.96] d phi and similarly
[46:30.40] d y is
[46:33.76] d x d r
[46:37.04] plus oops
[46:40.24] sorry d y is d y d r
[46:45.68] d r plus d y d phi
[46:48.88] d phi right that's just what it means
[46:53.60] the differential of the coordinates x
[46:56.08] and y
[46:56.88] we can substitute those two expressions
[46:58.96] into this
[47:00.56] into the metric here
[47:06.64] and then in the new coordinate system
[47:08.32] with respect to the new
[47:10.72] differentials d r and d phi we get the
[47:12.96] following expression
[47:14.16] for the metric we get a little exercise
[47:17.92] just for you to expand everything out we
[47:19.76] get d r times d r
[47:21.76] plus r squared d phi tensor d
[47:25.20] phi so a little increment in phi leads
[47:27.68] to a bigger change in the length
[47:29.76] um the further you are away from the
[47:32.16] origin so that should be i hope
[47:34.16] intuitively clear from polar coordinates
[47:38.40] if you've got a point on the the plane
[47:40.48] and you rotate
[47:42.40] then by an angle phi or d phi a little
[47:45.44] angle d
[47:45.92] phi then you create a bigger
[47:47.52] displacement the further away you are
[47:49.20] from the origin so that's why the metric
[47:50.80] has this different form
[47:52.24] in this new coordinate system and so
[47:54.00] this
[47:55.44] that's the metric in the new coordinate
[47:56.96] system
[48:03.12] and i
[48:06.24] might i should comment here that the
[48:07.68] components of the metric in this new
[48:09.44] coordinate system
[48:10.24] g r r is one g phi r equals
[48:13.68] g r phi equals zero and g phi
[48:17.04] phi has the components r squared
[48:21.12] now we've got the metric in our new
[48:22.48] coordinate system and we could have
[48:23.84] chosen another coordinate system but
[48:25.04] we're doing things with polar
[48:25.92] coordinates
[48:26.88] now let's calculate the christopher
[48:28.40] symbols so we have this
[48:30.24] formula for for the crystal symbols
[48:33.60] and that's in terms of the metric and
[48:35.28] it's inverse so we need to work out the
[48:36.64] inverse of the metric
[48:38.00] so uh i've written g i should have g
[48:41.84] prime r right and g prime
[48:45.04] so g prime now we can take the metric
[48:47.12] and represent it as a matrix right
[48:48.64] remember any
[48:49.68] two two index tensor can be represented
[48:52.48] as a matrix and we'll do exactly that
[48:54.96] uh and that matrix has the following
[48:57.28] components
[48:58.48] one zero zero r squared and
[49:02.72] we can form the inverse of this matrix
[49:08.72] and the inverse of this matrix is one
[49:10.48] zero zero one over r squared
[49:12.48] if you take this two by two matrix and
[49:13.84] multiply it by the other one you get the
[49:15.68] identity matrix
[49:17.36] and now we can actually start
[49:18.72] calculating these crystal symbols in
[49:20.32] this new coordinate system so we've got
[49:22.00] the
[49:23.04] gamma rr i claim that that's zero so
[49:26.88] whenever i don't have the equation for
[49:29.12] the crystal symbol
[49:30.08] you have to go ahead and
[49:33.52] check that these equations yourself
[49:36.48] gamma r
[49:37.28] r phi equals zero gamma phi
[49:40.56] r i is zero but what about gamma phi r
[49:44.24] phi what's that equal to
[49:47.44] well this turns out to be a non-trivial
[49:49.76] crystal symbol
[49:53.12] so let's work it out so according
[49:57.76] to the equation we have for the
[50:00.16] christopher symbols in terms of the
[50:01.44] metric
[50:02.88] this is up here somewhere
[50:06.80] here they are so we're going to now
[50:09.68] apply this formula here
[50:11.20] for the christopher symbols
[50:25.04] and maybe we call this triple star
[50:30.00] you see that i got the sum of a sigma
[50:31.60] here but because the matrix diagonal
[50:33.12] that that sum of a sigma is is gonna
[50:36.08] vanish we just have
[50:39.84] one term so so we apply
[50:43.84] triple star here
[50:48.40] and we just substitute for all these
[50:50.64] coordinates and
[50:51.68] the corresponding components of the
[50:54.56] metric so we've got
[50:56.16] ddr g55 plus dd phi
[51:01.44] g r phi minus dg
[51:05.68] r phi d phi
[51:13.44] okay so just applied the formula triple
[51:15.68] star for the
[51:16.96] uh crystal symbols
[51:20.16] now if you look at the metric the metric
[51:23.36] is zero anyway
[51:24.40] it has off diagonal component zero so
[51:26.32] they're gone but look at this first term
[51:27.92] that's actually not zero
[51:29.52] so g phi phi is equal to r squared
[51:34.00] so if you and
[51:37.28] the inverse of g evaluated g prime
[51:41.12] sorry should have been primes here
[51:45.04] and the inverse of g prime
[51:48.16] the phi phi component is one over r
[51:50.00] squared so substituting all this in
[51:55.60] gives us one over r for that crystal
[51:57.52] symbol so this is a non-trivial crystal
[51:59.12] symbol in this
[52:00.08] this coordinate basis and so similarly
[52:03.92] right
[52:11.20] we have that gamma phi
[52:14.24] r r is 0 gamma r
[52:17.52] phi phi is minus r you can go ahead and
[52:20.08] work that out yourself
[52:21.84] so this is exercise stuff you've see
[52:24.64] you've seen me do the
[52:25.68] equation uh the derivation for one of
[52:29.04] the crystal symbols is exactly the same
[52:31.20] computation every time and so here's the
[52:34.16] remaining
[52:35.36] crystal symbol so there's eight in total
[52:37.12] right there's two
[52:40.56] terms two times two crystal symbols
[52:43.76] so now let's actually do a computation
[52:46.08] of parallel transport in this new
[52:51.20] coordinate chart
[53:04.32] so we can parallel transport in any way
[53:06.56] in
[53:07.52] that we that we could imagine in any
[53:10.08] along any curve but let's just keep life
[53:11.84] simple
[53:12.88] so imagine we have
[53:16.08] a vector at the point p
[53:21.76] with some radial coordinate r
[53:26.24] and some angular coordinate phi and
[53:28.88] imagine we're going to parallel
[53:30.08] transport
[53:31.04] along the radial direction so
[53:43.52] we want a parallel transport a vector v
[53:45.84] along the curve this green curve c
[53:48.40] and this green curve c is just um
[53:51.44] displace along
[53:54.64] the radial direction
[54:00.40] so that's our curve so we know what is
[54:02.40] the tangent vector to this curve
[54:04.16] so t is the
[54:08.84] ddr right it's just
[54:11.04] you know displaced it's the tank it's
[54:13.12] the curve
[54:15.52] whose tangent vector is points in the
[54:18.16] radial direction and
[54:19.28] remember tangent vectors are identified
[54:20.72] with partial derivative operators ddr
[54:22.88] at the point p or in fact at any long at
[54:25.68] any point on the curve it's ddr
[54:34.48] so that's that's our goal we want to
[54:36.64] parallel transport this vector
[54:38.08] v along the curve c which goes in the
[54:41.20] radial direction
[54:45.84] so t is d d r
[54:49.12] which means that you know in components
[54:52.00] t
[54:52.32] mu d d x prime mu prime
[54:55.84] u prime that implies that t
[54:59.12] of the t phi component
[55:03.92] is equal to zero and the tr component
[55:07.44] is equal to one
[55:11.92] now we write out the parallel transport
[55:14.00] equation
[55:15.36] so that's dvr
[55:37.28] and the parallel transport condition
[55:38.64] right remember it says t a delta a
[55:41.04] vb equals zero now in components
[55:45.44] in the coordinate system we have chosen
[55:48.00] that is equal to
[55:49.36] the little exercise right dvr the the r
[55:52.80] component of our tangent vector
[55:56.48] has to transform as such vr
[55:59.76] plus gamma
[56:10.88] and that's one you know there's two
[56:13.04] parts to this
[56:14.08] there's two components two equations the
[56:16.72] phi component
[56:18.08] of the l tangent vector has to transform
[56:20.64] such
[56:26.08] now if you look at these two equations
[56:27.68] right we can now substitute in for the
[56:29.52] christopher symbols
[56:32.32] um and i did that in the second equation
[56:36.32] already
[56:36.88] so we know that that gamma r r
[56:40.00] gamma r r r is zero
[56:43.20] so that's that's zero there and gamma r
[56:46.48] phi should also be zero if i remember
[56:48.96] correctly yep
[56:51.84] so we have that now our parallel
[56:54.08] transport conditions for the vector
[56:56.16] v and its components
[56:59.28] for the components of the vector v so
[57:01.68] these
[57:02.88] parallel transport conditions are that d
[57:05.76] v
[57:06.00] d r the radial component of a tangent
[57:10.00] vector as you parallel transport it
[57:11.60] doesn't change right
[57:12.72] so as you if you go back to this picture
[57:14.24] here if you have a vector v
[57:16.16] and there's a radial component and as
[57:17.92] you slide it along the curve
[57:19.68] in the radial direction that radial
[57:21.04] component doesn't grow or get it doesn't
[57:22.88] get bigger or gets more
[57:25.36] but if you have a phi component
[57:30.32] then you have to solve a little
[57:31.28] differential equation
[57:34.16] uh to work out
[57:37.84] how a the phi component of the vector v
[57:41.04] should transform
[57:45.12] let's so we have to
[57:49.04] solve this differential equation here so
[57:51.68] that
[57:53.12] is the same as solving one over v phi
[57:56.32] d b phi has got to equal minus one over
[57:58.88] r
[57:59.36] d r so we'll just
[58:02.40] integrate this so we get
[58:05.60] uh log of v phi equals
[58:09.52] minus log of
[58:12.56] r plus some constant
[58:17.84] and then exponentiating both sides we
[58:20.88] learned that v
[58:21.60] phi depends on
[58:26.88] equals one it depends inversely with r
[58:29.28] times by some constant
[58:30.64] a
[58:34.32] yeah let's just call it a
[58:38.16] a is a constant that's determined by
[58:43.44] initial conditions
[58:47.76] so we learned that as you parallel
[58:49.28] transport a vector
[58:51.60] along a radial uh curve in polar
[58:54.96] coordinates
[58:56.72] you better be rescaling that that
[58:59.84] phi component as you go along the the
[59:02.24] radial component and that makes some
[59:03.52] sense right because if you didn't
[59:04.72] rescale it then because the the
[59:07.20] the basis vector that points in the
[59:09.44] direction phi
[59:10.96] is effectively larger and larger as you
[59:12.64] go along the curve
[59:14.24] uh the vector the tangential component
[59:16.88] in the phi direction would be getting
[59:18.48] larger and larger as your parallel
[59:19.68] transport but that's not does not
[59:21.12] accord with our notion of parallel
[59:22.48] transport so that's why
[59:24.48] we have to rescale this component of the
[59:27.60] vector v phi
[59:28.48] in polar coordinates
[59:33.04] now that's a little this is a very
[59:35.68] simple
[59:36.32] this is almost the simplest possible
[59:37.84] example of working with
[59:39.52] derivative operators metrics and um
[59:44.08] connections and christopher symbols
[59:47.28] and but hopefully it should illustrate
[59:48.88] to you why there's no choice
[59:50.32] in the uh in our derivative operator so
[59:52.96] once you you
[59:54.00] choose a coordinate basis and a
[59:57.04] derivative
[59:57.76] operator the derivative operator is
[60:00.24] determined
[60:00.96] by the christopher symbols with respect
[60:02.96] to that coordinate chart
[60:09.76] now i want to spend a little bit time
[60:12.00] discussing
[60:13.04] the tensorial or lack of tensorial
[60:15.44] nature of the christopher symbols
[60:18.88] there has been some additional
[60:20.24] discussion in the comments of the
[60:21.60] previous video
[60:22.80] on the tensorial or lack of tensorial
[60:25.28] character
[60:25.92] of the coefficients cabc
[60:29.44] and um i do encourage you to read those
[60:31.68] those comments and also
[60:33.36] uh to take a look uh
[60:36.64] at the the note i gave on my blog
[60:40.64] on on the definition of the coordinate
[60:43.52] derivative hopefully that helps
[60:45.44] but i want to explain what what
[60:49.52] uh how these crystal symbols change when
[60:52.24] you change coordinate charts
[60:56.48] so we'll just take a little digression
[60:57.84] now to explain how
[60:59.76] these crystal symbols transform as you
[61:01.84] change coordinate systems
[61:03.44] so suppose delta x is an affine
[61:08.84] connection
[61:13.52] what we're going to do is understand how
[61:15.60] these crystal symbols arise in a
[61:17.36] tensorial
[61:18.56] setting so what we're going to do is let
[61:21.04] omega
[61:22.72] be a tensor
[61:26.96] of type
[61:32.16] zero one so we've called such things
[61:34.08] also we've called them
[61:35.44] one forms
[61:42.88] so the object delta x
[61:46.08] omega is per definition
[61:49.36] a tensor of type zero one
[62:00.56] zero two right
[62:17.60] so let's say
[62:21.52] be a chart
[62:25.60] for a coordinate system
[62:32.16] what we're going to do is now choose
[62:34.32] well we're going to write out
[62:36.24] our ingredients here in terms of the
[62:38.72] coordinate basis
[62:40.00] so the vector field x is written as
[62:43.44] ddx mu
[62:48.80] at the point p and the one form
[62:52.40] we're going to choose in coordinates the
[62:54.96] one form to have
[62:56.16] the representation dx nu
[63:01.20] so this is a specific choice for the
[63:03.84] vector
[63:04.80] x and a specific choice
[63:09.12] for the one form omega
[63:13.12] i'm just going to take a moment to
[63:14.56] confirm an equation here
[63:29.28] ah yeah yeah sorry
[63:35.04] the object delta x omega is a still a
[63:38.00] one form right that
[63:39.12] the once you hand it so it's very
[63:40.88] important to note that a derivative
[63:42.64] operator
[63:43.52] is a device which takes a vector
[63:47.28] and then transforms the object or
[63:50.32] differentiates the object in the
[63:51.68] direction of that vector
[63:53.12] and produces another instance of that
[63:55.20] object so sorry i wrote
[63:57.36] t02 before that would have been correct
[64:00.00] had i
[64:00.72] left this so
[64:04.24] with an open index but we don't have
[64:07.20] that we have
[64:08.16] in fact we're making a specific choice
[64:10.24] for the vector
[64:12.56] component there so the
[64:16.16] the derivative
[64:20.40] of a tensor is
[64:23.76] a tensor of type kl
[64:26.88] plus 1 but the moment you make a choice
[64:29.68] for this vector
[64:30.80] entry here big x then you
[64:34.16] you get another instance of the tensor
[64:36.40] that you're differentiating
[64:38.56] now we're going to take this
[64:41.84] so we know that once we've applied the
[64:44.16] derivative operator to
[64:45.36] a one form we get another one form back
[64:47.44] and it transforms as a one form
[64:49.12] according to the tensor transformation
[64:50.80] law
[64:52.72] and uh we're now just gonna make a
[64:54.72] choice for
[64:55.76] uh these two uh elements here we're
[64:58.56] gonna make a choice for
[64:59.44] the vector x being one of the coordinate
[65:03.44] basis elements and we're gonna make a
[65:04.96] choice for this one form as one of the
[65:06.96] coordinate the dual
[65:08.00] coordinate bases vectors
[65:12.08] and if you substitute make these
[65:15.12] this choice substituted into this
[65:16.80] expression here for the
[65:18.80] derivative operator then
[65:22.00] you will see where the christopher
[65:25.12] symbols appear
[65:26.00] in this
[65:30.16] expression so if you if you calculate
[65:32.08] out now
[65:34.16] uh the derivative of
[65:37.28] a one basis one form with respect to a
[65:39.36] basis vector
[65:41.04] and you substitute the these two
[65:44.08] uh elements into the equation for the
[65:47.20] derivative of a tensor then you find out
[65:49.44] that you'll get precisely this
[65:50.80] expression for the coefficients
[65:52.96] for the for this derivative and this
[65:55.52] involves these christopher symbols here
[65:58.80] now this geometrically for each choice
[66:01.92] of mu and nu
[66:11.36] so for each choice you know this is a
[66:13.52] bases dependent choice now
[66:17.36] of mu nu we get
[66:20.48] uh we get a one form
[66:26.24] or tensor
[66:32.08] type zero one
[66:37.04] so you know we've got a bunch of one
[66:38.64] forms indexed by mu and u
[66:40.40] and these have a name these are called
[66:41.60] the connection one forms
[66:51.36] another way of thinking of this as is
[66:54.16] there's a bunch of
[66:55.36] tenses of type 1 1 indexed by a vector
[66:58.24] we won't
[66:59.04] go into that i'll link a discussion in
[67:02.40] stack overflow
[67:04.08] if you're interested in that perspective
[67:22.88] now we've seen how these connection
[67:26.24] coefficients
[67:27.36] christopher symbols look like in one
[67:29.76] chart
[67:30.56] and we've even done a calculation where
[67:32.48] we've
[67:33.60] looked at these christopher symbols in
[67:35.20] another chart and we've seen that
[67:37.20] they're different
[67:37.76] right and that's
[67:40.96] a very important observation we learned
[67:42.72] that even though the crystal symbols
[67:44.00] might vanish in one chart
[67:45.84] in another they may be non-zero so that
[67:48.64] implies that the crystal symbols
[67:50.00] themselves don't transform as a tensor
[67:51.92] type one two
[67:55.68] but how do they transform well that's
[67:57.84] the task now
[68:01.04] so let's suppose the derivative operator
[68:02.88] is the coordinate derivative with
[68:04.08] respect
[68:06.08] for a chart uh u
[68:11.04] psi u is just the open set containing
[68:13.36] the point p that we're interested in
[68:15.28] and then we're going to consider another
[68:16.80] chart that v psi prime
[68:18.80] be another chart
[68:24.40] such that right we can't just choose any
[68:26.08] old chart it has to at least have
[68:28.08] some intersection with our original
[68:31.52] chart otherwise
[68:32.40] nothing further what i say will make
[68:34.08] sense
[68:35.84] and the coordinates we're going to write
[68:37.92] the coordinates
[68:39.20] of our chart v as y
[68:44.00] instead of x
[68:51.12] and
[68:54.48] now let's take a look at the
[68:58.48] christopher symbols and the uh and the
[69:01.36] way
[69:01.76] they determine the derivative operator
[69:03.76] in these two charts
[69:05.28] so let's look at the derivative of a
[69:08.48] vector
[69:09.28] t yeah so
[69:12.40] t i've been using before as a curve
[69:14.59] [Music]
[69:19.04] let's just say v
[69:24.40] this is just the ordinary covariance
[69:26.40] derivative
[69:27.68] with respect to in general
[69:31.44] of a vector v
[69:36.32] now how do we connect this with the the
[69:38.80] crystal symbols that we have in a given
[69:40.48] basis well
[69:41.68] we know this connection right you can
[69:43.60] always
[69:45.52] this is just the dual version of what i
[69:47.04] wrote above
[69:51.20] you note that if you choose a coordinate
[69:53.60] basis
[69:54.80] ddx alpha and then
[69:57.92] take the covariance derivative
[70:03.52] of another coordinate basis element d dx
[70:05.68] beta that that
[70:07.04] actually involves the crystal symbols
[70:10.16] on the left hand side
[70:17.36] so this is just setting up the data of
[70:19.20] parallel transport in the coordinate
[70:20.80] system determined by psi
[70:22.72] but now let's go to
[70:34.56] now we're going to write this all out in
[70:35.84] the coordinate system psi prime
[70:39.52] well we need to work out
[70:42.84] how our derivative operator basis
[70:47.84] our tangent vector basis transforms
[70:49.68] under this change of coordinates
[70:55.52] so we're going to define
[70:58.56] the following basis
[71:03.12] vector for the tangent space in our new
[71:05.12] coordinate system ddx
[71:06.64] alpha but how does that look in terms of
[71:08.08] our old basis well we just have to
[71:10.32] change the coordinate system
[71:13.28] that's how it looks in the old basis so
[71:15.92] it's a linear combination of those
[71:17.28] tangent vectors
[71:19.36] and then we also define the christopher
[71:21.60] symbols
[71:22.56] with respect to this new basis
[71:30.24] well i said set before but i think i
[71:32.32] prefer the
[71:35.04] the terminology to note you just know
[71:36.80] that the chris double symbols
[71:39.28] can be obtained by computing the
[71:42.56] covariant derivative of a basis element
[71:44.80] with respect to another basis
[71:47.36] so now we define the christopher symbols
[71:51.20] with respect to our new bases
[71:56.08] analogously we'll call them gamma
[71:59.04] twittle
[71:59.76] alpha beta ddy beta
[72:07.04] or define or rather node yeah because
[72:09.92] it's just
[72:10.40] this is the notation we're setting up so
[72:12.24] the crystal symbols with respect to the
[72:13.68] new basis
[72:15.04] are defined by computing the covariance
[72:18.16] derivative of a tangent basis vector
[72:20.16] with respect to another tangent space
[72:21.76] vector
[72:22.72] tangent basis vector
[72:26.40] but now we've got we've got two things
[72:29.52] at play now we've got
[72:31.04] the the crystal symbols defined with
[72:33.28] respect to one coordinate basis
[72:35.60] and we want to see and we've got uh the
[72:37.84] coordinate basis in the new coordinate
[72:39.28] system but
[72:39.84] let's try and express everything i mean
[72:41.36] in principle we should be able to
[72:43.36] express y d y back in terms of our old
[72:46.72] bases and therefore perhaps we should be
[72:48.56] able to extract out
[72:50.00] an equation that relates delta a the
[72:52.48] codex crystal symbols in the new bases
[72:54.72] to the crystal symbols in the older
[72:56.24] bases
[72:59.52] so let's substitute now
[73:04.48] this expression into
[73:09.28] the definition of the christopher
[73:10.56] symbols in our new basis i'm going to
[73:12.24] substitute that into here i'm going to
[73:13.84] substitute that into there
[73:19.68] and then we have a slightly lengthy
[73:20.80] calculation to do
[73:24.32] so we get d squared mu d y
[73:27.68] alpha d y beta
[73:31.60] d d x mu
[73:37.76] plus d d x lambda e y
[73:41.04] alpha d x mu
[73:44.16] d y beta and then
[73:47.28] oops
[73:50.80] d d x lambda d e x
[73:54.08] mu so all we've done here is substitute
[73:58.72] this expression here in the brackets
[74:02.72] into both places where the coordinate
[74:06.80] bases
[74:07.92] tangent vector ddy stood
[74:20.24] now writing expanding out all these
[74:26.84] derivatives
[74:29.12] and relabeling the indices gives us the
[74:32.64] following expression
[74:56.88] and we know that that's
[75:05.28] just like he tells us an equation that
[75:10.88] relates the crystal symbols in the new
[75:12.40] bases to the crystal symbols in the old
[75:14.08] bases
[75:16.40] so the the gamma alpha beta gamma
[75:22.84] twiddles
[75:31.76] have to be related to the
[75:34.96] christopher symbols in the original
[75:36.48] basis according to this formula
[75:38.32] otherwise
[75:41.20] nothing this equation wouldn't work
[75:50.84] right
[75:56.08] so we've actually determined
[75:59.52] the transformation law by comparing
[76:01.60] these two definitions of
[76:02.88] christopher symbols as
[76:06.16] conveying derivatives of tangent bases
[76:07.92] vectors we determine the transformation
[76:10.08] law of the christopher symbols and we
[76:11.44] see something
[76:12.08] very interesting so
[76:17.36] in particular we see that the crystal
[76:19.68] symbols don't transform as a tensor but
[76:21.68] as something a bit different so the
[76:23.04] first term
[76:23.84] is the tensorial transformation law but
[76:26.96] there's this additional term
[76:28.96] that comes that depends on the second
[76:30.96] derivatives of the coordinates
[76:32.56] with respect to the new coordinates the
[76:34.00] old coordinates with respect to the new
[76:35.20] coordinates
[76:36.64] and that's responsible for this
[76:37.84] inhomogeneous part
[76:39.68] of the crystal symbols in the polar
[76:42.00] coordinates
[76:45.44] and it's worth noting that when
[76:49.76] gamma transforms in this way
[77:00.16] we are ensuring that
[77:03.36] gamma x y is a vector
[77:12.72] and that i'll leave as an exercise for
[77:14.84] you
[77:17.60] where x in one coordinate system
[77:23.12] and y is given it's so in one coordinate
[77:28.84] system
[77:30.64] versus x twiddle
[77:35.60] in a new coordinate system oops it
[77:37.76] should be y of course
[77:47.44] so by having these the the fact that the
[77:50.48] crystal symbols transform in this
[77:51.92] particular inhomogeneous way
[77:53.44] ensures that the covariant derivative of
[77:56.48] one vector with respect to another
[77:59.60] is independent of coordinate system
[78:01.36] chosen so that's a i mean it's not such
[78:03.44] a
[78:09.92] challenging exercise but it's very very
[78:11.60] revealing so the exercise is
[78:14.32] show that delta x y computed with
[78:17.52] respect to
[78:19.76] the original coordinate system is
[78:21.28] actually equal to x twiddle
[78:24.84] alpha
[78:26.96] d d y alpha x oops y
[78:31.36] y twiddle beta
[78:36.96] d y beta so you've got to show that
[78:40.08] those two
[78:40.88] ways of calculating things give exactly
[78:42.80] the same answers
[78:54.08] and that's your exercise you know you
[78:55.60] substitute in the definition left
[78:57.12] substitute in the right sum over some
[78:58.96] repeated indices
[79:00.24] get some matrices and inverses and then
[79:02.56] you'll convince yourself
[79:04.00] that delta x y in one coordinate system
[79:07.04] behaves exactly as this transforms in
[79:10.32] exactly the right way
[79:11.84] so that in the new coordinate system you
[79:13.28] get the same vector
[79:16.40] okay so that's to briefly summarize
[79:20.08] in this part of the the lecture i've
[79:21.76] been focusing on the geometrical
[79:24.16] nature of the affine connection and the
[79:26.16] covariance derivative
[79:27.52] i've pointed out that the christopher
[79:29.76] symbols
[79:30.64] are embedded in various formulae
[79:34.16] for the covariant derivative in
[79:36.64] particular if you take the covariance
[79:37.92] derivative of a basis
[79:39.68] joule vector or a basis tangent vector
[79:42.08] the customizable symbols appear
[79:48.00] uh in the definitions of these
[79:50.16] covariance derivatives and
[79:53.84] and furthermore that if you transform
[79:57.28] to a different coordinate system the
[79:59.60] crystal symbols transform in
[80:01.12] precisely the right way so that these
[80:03.28] geometrical objects remain vectors
[80:08.32] so for the final topic today i want to
[80:11.04] talk about
[80:12.88] a particular class of curves on
[80:16.88] manifolds that will play an
[80:18.00] extraordinarily important role in
[80:19.36] general relativity
[80:20.88] namely geodesics
[80:24.16] so let m gab
[80:28.00] be a manifold with metric
[80:40.16] and hence implicitly we have a
[80:41.60] derivative operator determined
[80:44.40] so we're going to have uh we're going to
[80:46.64] introduce a special class of curves
[80:50.40] on this manifold and these curves are
[80:53.12] called geodesics and what are they well
[80:54.80] they are
[80:55.36] in intuitively
[81:00.56] a geodesic is the straightest
[81:03.60] possible curve you can draw
[81:07.12] on m
[81:20.48] so straight is because the straightest
[81:22.72] possible curve you can trace
[81:24.24] through m now it's i'll give you the
[81:27.36] motivation of this in
[81:29.04] of this concept in terms of embedded
[81:32.32] manifolds
[81:34.16] and then hopefully that'll motivate the
[81:37.36] definition that we have the intrinsic
[81:39.92] definition that we come up presently
[81:41.36] with i hope you'll be motivated by this
[81:43.76] so suppose you have a manifold m you
[81:45.52] know i'm taking here the surface of the
[81:46.96] sphere
[81:47.52] embedded into three space now it's
[81:50.64] kind of clear that the some curves are
[81:52.64] straighter than other curves right
[81:54.64] so let's take a look at this curve here
[81:56.24] in red it connects the points p and q so
[81:58.72] it wiggles all around
[82:00.16] the sphere the surface of this here but
[82:02.32] it gets to
[82:03.20] q eventually starts at p ends at q
[82:07.68] so the red curve is a curve on on
[82:10.96] m but somehow it's not the straightest
[82:13.12] curve right
[82:14.00] there exists a curve that is straight up
[82:17.84] that goes between p and q namely just go
[82:21.12] around the great circle
[82:23.12] so there exists a straighter curve that
[82:25.92] we can draw
[82:27.04] between p and q namely a great circle
[82:32.16] and the thing to note about this
[82:34.80] straighter curve
[82:36.56] is that it has a shorter length right
[82:38.96] you can imagine
[82:40.08] adding up the length of these two curves
[82:44.40] but there's another important feature of
[82:46.96] this
[82:47.44] straighter curve that may be
[82:50.96] not apparent at first sight
[82:54.16] but it is the notion that we may that we
[82:56.40] can make intrinsic
[82:58.96] namely a geodesic or this
[83:02.00] straightest curve green is a curve whose
[83:04.48] tangent vector is actually parallel
[83:06.24] transported
[83:07.20] along the curve itself
[83:14.56] so you can look at the the great circle
[83:16.64] and you
[83:17.68] imagine parallel transporting it's the
[83:20.48] tangent vector itself
[83:22.40] along itself
[83:25.76] so the tangent vector of a great circle
[83:27.52] sort of points along the great circle
[83:29.60] and you see that yeah indeed the tangent
[83:32.84] vector
[83:34.72] of the curve is parallel transported
[83:37.52] along itself
[83:44.64] and the red curve does not have that
[83:46.84] feature
[83:48.72] but the beautiful thing is now we have
[83:50.40] an intrinsic notion of tangible vector
[83:52.16] we have an intrinsic notion of parallel
[83:54.48] transporter
[83:56.24] so we actually have
[83:59.68] an intrinsic notion of a geodesic the
[84:02.80] shortest curve
[84:04.00] on a manifold
[84:08.08] so a geodesic is a curve satisfying
[84:12.96] the following condition namely ta delta
[84:15.28] a t
[84:16.08] b equals zero
[84:33.68] so now let's choose a coordinate system
[84:36.96] and look at that expression
[84:40.72] in terms of in terms of a specific
[84:42.72] coordinate system side
[84:45.12] so the geodesic itself in a coordinate
[84:47.28] system of a manifold
[84:50.32] is is a curve and a curve has
[84:53.36] coordinates
[84:54.24] x mu and they depend on some parameter t
[84:58.08] lowercase t and we're in a coordinate
[85:00.80] chart so it's in rn
[85:02.80] so according to star right this notion
[85:05.76] of parallel transport that we have
[85:07.44] earlier
[85:10.48] in today's lecture we have that the
[85:13.12] components
[85:14.64] of our tangent vector in this coordinate
[85:16.88] system
[85:18.48] have to obey this condition
[85:21.92] the parallel transport condition but now
[85:24.00] in place of v
[85:25.20] we're putting the tangent vector itself
[85:28.40] now since
[85:31.76] these components are nothing other than
[85:34.08] dxmu dt
[85:37.04] we have in this coordinate system
[85:40.24] the so-called geodesic equation
[85:46.24] which is a second order
[85:51.52] set of nonlinear ordinary
[85:55.28] differential equations
[86:10.64] it's a coupled set of nonlinear ordinary
[86:13.92] differential equations but now of second
[86:15.60] order with respect to the parameter t
[86:17.84] specifying the point along the curve
[86:36.08] it's a system of n ordinary differential
[86:38.32] equations of second order
[86:42.16] and this is with respect to a coordinate
[86:43.92] uh basis
[86:45.52] so as soon as you have a metric to
[86:48.32] summarize the content of today's lecture
[86:50.64] as soon as you have a metric you
[86:52.80] determine a unique derivative operator
[86:55.44] for a manifold and with respect to
[86:59.44] this uniquely determined derivative
[87:01.92] operator we can define the notion of
[87:03.76] parallel transport of a vector
[87:05.84] and finally applying that notion of
[87:07.92] parallel transport
[87:09.20] to the tangent vector to a curve itself
[87:11.60] we introduce the notion of a geodesic as
[87:13.60] the shortest possible curve that
[87:15.20] connects two points
[87:16.80] on a manifold m as a candidate
[87:20.32] i should say for the notion of the
[87:22.16] shortest possible curve
[87:23.36] connecting two points on a manifold m as
[87:26.32] we'll see
[87:27.04] in coming lectures geodesics play in
[87:29.76] very
[87:30.24] er they played a special role in general
[87:32.48] relativity a central role
[87:34.24] um as they are realize
[87:37.52] uh freely falling uh observers in
[87:40.16] general relativity so we're gonna say
[87:41.92] that an observer is freely foiling if it
[87:43.84] moves on a geodesic
[87:45.20] on the manifold determined by space time
[87:47.36] itself
[87:48.56] and as we'll see that plays an ex very
[87:50.40] important role in
[87:52.48] in obtaining einstein's field equations
[87:55.28] and also
[87:56.16] in determining the dynamics of freely
[87:58.08] falling observers
[87:59.76] that will be a topic for the coming
[88:01.52] lectures but for today that's it
[88:03.44] thank you very much and see you next
[88:05.36] time
