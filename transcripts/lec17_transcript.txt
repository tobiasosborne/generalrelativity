[00:00.00] hello and welcome back to introduction
[00:01.52] to general relativity
[00:03.12] in today's lecture we're going to solve
[00:05.20] einstein's field equations
[00:07.20] for the case of a homogeneous and
[00:09.36] isotropic space time
[00:11.12] well more properly we're going to
[00:12.40] commence the solution of einstein's
[00:14.00] field equations for homogeneous and
[00:15.68] isotropic
[00:16.16] universe so that brings us to the topic
[00:19.76] of the dynamics
[00:24.80] of a homogeneous
[00:28.56] and isotropic
[00:32.88] universe how does
[00:36.16] such a universe evolve from its
[00:39.68] inception so to speak to its final
[00:42.96] moments if there are any
[00:46.96] so we're going to do is we we've only
[00:49.12] described in the previous lecture half
[00:50.64] the story right we've described the
[00:52.32] the structure of the metric of a
[00:53.84] homogeneous and isotropic universe and
[00:55.36] we've reduced the task of of uh
[00:58.40] solving this metric in einstein's field
[01:01.52] equation to that of
[01:03.12] solving for a single scalar function a
[01:04.88] of tau
[01:06.32] now we've got to describe the other half
[01:08.00] of einstein field equations namely the
[01:09.60] stress energy tensor what's the stress
[01:11.12] energy tends that we can assume or
[01:12.48] attach to a homogeneous and isotropic
[01:14.48] universe
[01:16.00] so it's a highly idealized model
[01:19.04] so we're going to idealize galaxies in
[01:21.04] this model
[01:22.24] to grains of dust
[01:29.12] and we're going to further assume that
[01:33.36] these galaxies really move they don't
[01:36.48] have much
[01:37.12] initial velocity of their own in fact
[01:39.44] they're going to move on
[01:41.12] world lines of isotropic observers
[02:00.88] now these gravit these galaxies will
[02:03.04] have some fluctuations in their
[02:04.32] velocities
[02:06.64] you know the universe isn't completely
[02:08.56] isotropic and
[02:09.76] and homogeneous but in order to model
[02:12.96] the stress energy distribution of the
[02:14.88] universe we're going to assume
[02:16.88] in this highly simplifies highly
[02:18.88] simplified idealized model
[02:20.56] that the fluctuations of these galaxy
[02:22.48] velocities is very small
[02:31.84] is much smaller than any other
[02:36.32] quantity
[02:40.40] in particular the speed of light and so
[02:42.08] in this way we're going to neglect any
[02:43.76] form of pressure
[02:45.84] in in modeling the stress energy
[02:50.80] tensor of the matter of our universe
[02:54.80] and uh in that sense uh it's pretty easy
[02:57.36] to write down the stress energy tensor
[03:01.12] you know the stress energy tensor is
[03:02.56] that of just a homogenic homogeneous
[03:05.04] uniform gas of
[03:06.80] particles with no pressure
[03:14.96] so this is just the stress energy tensor
[03:16.40] of the galaxy of the matter content
[03:18.08] the visible matter content
[03:22.16] and it's super simple we just take
[03:25.84] the matter to move on the world lines of
[03:28.96] isotropic observers
[03:31.20] easy where rho of course is the
[03:34.24] density
[03:37.52] of the density average density
[03:49.20] so you smear out the galaxies until
[03:51.28] they're a homogenous
[03:53.04] soup so that was easy uh we could throw
[03:57.28] that
[03:57.60] into einstein's field equations right
[03:59.12] now and try and solve things but we
[04:01.36] wouldn't be
[04:01.92] modeling the physics of our universe
[04:03.52] quite correctly yet because there is
[04:05.68] more uh stress energy mass
[04:08.88] energy content to our universe
[04:12.40] in fact there's at least one other field
[04:14.56] that will impact play a role in the the
[04:17.12] evolution of our universe
[04:18.96] and that is the electromagnetic field
[04:23.04] so there is experimentally determined
[04:25.92] background thermal radiation
[04:28.80] throughout our universe it's at
[04:30.88] approximately at a temperature of 3
[04:32.32] kelvin
[04:33.60] and
[04:36.80] we're going to model this background
[04:38.48] radiation also as a
[04:40.16] as a perfect fluid
[04:52.24] it's a somewhat advanced exercise
[04:56.08] pretty advanced exercise involving a
[04:57.60] little bit of statistical physics to
[04:59.04] argue that
[05:00.00] the thermal state of the electromagnetic
[05:02.64] field
[05:03.12] can be modeled with a with a perfect
[05:05.20] fluid stress energy tensor
[05:12.80] i mean there aren't so many options
[05:14.56] right in this in this situation of
[05:16.16] homogeneity and isotropy
[05:19.60] so there aren't
[05:23.28] so many symmetric homogenous isotropic
[05:27.84] uh four tenses that you can write down
[05:32.08] and so you're pretty much reduced to to
[05:34.00] just describing things in terms of
[05:35.68] diagonal
[05:37.36] 4x4 matrices where the three spatial
[05:40.40] components are equal and the temporal
[05:42.08] component is
[05:42.96] potentially unequal so we use for the
[05:46.80] stress
[05:47.20] energy tensor of the the radiation field
[05:49.36] the perfect
[05:50.84] fluid stress energy tensor
[05:54.96] where in this case uh the pressure of
[05:58.24] the radiation field is exactly
[06:00.32] one-third of the density
[06:04.88] and thus the total stress energy tensor
[06:07.36] of the universe
[06:12.16] is as i just mentioned before is as
[06:14.16] general as it can be
[06:17.92] while respecting these additional
[06:19.44] symmetries
[06:22.08] and that is it has this perfect fluid
[06:24.72] form
[06:25.12] but where p and rho are appropriately
[06:27.76] adjusted to
[06:28.64] incorporate the galaxy matter content
[06:32.16] and the radiation
[06:46.84] metacontent
[06:51.28] uh and so i'm gonna just say most
[06:53.44] general
[06:58.00] is and i think you i could safely eat
[07:00.00] that as an exercise for you
[07:02.16] what is the most general stress energy
[07:03.68] tensor you can write down well it also
[07:05.12] has
[07:06.16] essentially this perfect fluid form but
[07:09.12] rho
[07:09.60] and p are no longer just p rad and rho
[07:12.32] rad
[07:12.72] and p galaxy and so on they they have to
[07:15.28] be adjusted those constants to
[07:16.56] incorporate
[07:18.24] these contributions
[07:22.24] so that's extraordinarily simple
[07:27.04] stress energy tensor it's a diagonal
[07:28.56] stress energy tensor if you look at it
[07:30.32] in the
[07:31.28] coordinate system we've been working in
[07:33.76] and the spatial components are all equal
[07:37.76] and now what we're going to do is we've
[07:40.08] got the right hand side of einstein's
[07:41.36] field equations
[07:42.48] so now we're really in a situation where
[07:44.64] we can
[07:45.76] uh write out the full equations of
[07:48.48] motion
[07:49.28] for the our universe that we learn
[07:56.32] so no perturbation theory here no
[07:58.08] approximations here we're going to go
[07:59.36] for a full solution today
[08:01.28] and in the next lectures
[08:08.08] and einstein's field equations well what
[08:10.08] do we need well
[08:12.24] we need the einstein tensor g big g we
[08:15.12] need the stress energy intensity a b so
[08:16.96] we have
[08:17.60] the metric we have the stress energy
[08:19.84] tensor and i've added on here an extra
[08:22.08] term
[08:23.28] called the cosmological constant term
[08:29.68] that's a consistent one can add this
[08:33.36] equation
[08:34.56] add this this term to einstein's field
[08:36.32] equation einstein himself also added
[08:38.56] this equation uh this constant
[08:41.28] term to the field equations
[08:45.92] although he for very very different
[08:47.52] reasons
[08:49.12] which we if you're interested in the
[08:51.28] history of general relativity
[08:54.64] you can look up
[09:07.28] so we've added an additional term lambda
[09:10.32] the cosmological constant and it turns
[09:13.36] out that although it was hoped that
[09:15.92] lambda by einstein
[09:19.36] who added it in order to model an
[09:21.12] internal universe
[09:22.64] uh it was later hoped that
[09:25.92] lambda would be zero well that's not the
[09:27.60] case we
[09:28.96] the observations now favor
[09:33.36] a non-zero value of lambda and it's
[09:37.52] these observations have essentially been
[09:39.36] independently uh
[09:41.28] verified now um
[09:46.32] and what do we need for well we need to
[09:48.40] account for the observed
[09:51.28] cosmic background radiation
[09:57.84] but also very recently
[09:59.63] [Music]
[10:01.12] this term the non-vanishing of this term
[10:04.96] was also uh independently
[10:08.56] largely verified by
[10:12.88] the dark energy surveys which have just
[10:15.12] been
[10:16.00] completed or just begun we're just
[10:17.76] beginning to analyze the data from these
[10:19.36] dark energy surveys
[10:20.64] so the cosmological constant is here to
[10:22.80] stay we have to have it
[10:24.56] uh in order to match uh to model the
[10:28.08] universe that we live in
[10:30.40] so why not for this rest of these next
[10:33.52] coming lectures
[10:34.24] included in our solution of einstein's
[10:35.92] field equation turns out to be rather
[10:37.28] easy to do so it just
[10:38.80] effectively adjusts uh it acts like a
[10:41.76] negative pressure term
[10:46.40] so in principle so how hard is it to
[10:48.32] solve einstein's field equations well
[10:50.16] you know in principle
[10:52.08] we need to solve 10
[10:55.36] simultaneous coupled nonlinear partial
[10:58.08] differential equations
[11:09.52] and you know and why 10 well the
[11:12.64] variables
[11:13.44] in einstein's field equation is the
[11:15.04] metric the metric is a 4x4 matrix
[11:17.92] a 4x4 matrix has 16 terms
[11:21.28] but if it's a symmetric 4x4 matrix which
[11:24.08] it is in the case of
[11:27.36] our space time that we live in then only
[11:29.68] 10 10 components are actually
[11:31.44] independent so you only need to solve
[11:33.04] for 10
[11:34.00] things 10 uh variables
[11:37.52] now 10 10 nonlinear couple
[11:41.28] pde uh is is ridiculous
[11:44.40] uh ridiculously complicated most of your
[11:46.96] career in physics
[11:48.08] let's say you know unless you've been
[11:50.32] heavily involved in
[11:52.56] fluid mechanics or something has been
[11:55.28] mostly occupied with linear
[11:56.72] partial differential equations or
[11:58.48] ordinary differential equations
[12:00.96] uh you've probably in fluid mechanics
[12:02.88] encountered
[12:04.08] uh nonlinear partial differential
[12:06.16] equations but
[12:07.12] not like ten you have the worst case
[12:10.32] scenarios like navier stokes equation
[12:13.28] and so this is an a monstrous system
[12:16.96] of complexity far far
[12:20.32] exceeding anything that you're likely to
[12:22.24] encounter in any other branch of physics
[12:26.16] and so you can't hope to have a general
[12:28.64] solution you know there's no greens
[12:30.16] function nothing's going to save you in
[12:31.52] general it's it's absolutely
[12:33.44] an orders of magnitude more ambitious a
[12:36.56] task to solve these equations of motion
[12:39.04] however you can either use perturbation
[12:42.00] theory as we have done
[12:43.60] in the previous lecture or you can
[12:44.96] exploit symmetry so to reduce the number
[12:46.80] of equations you have to solve
[12:48.40] and keep reducing until you hopefully
[12:49.92] just get to some one non-linear or
[12:52.24] ordinary differential equation and that
[12:54.48] you can solve
[12:55.28] you just integrate by quadratures or
[12:56.80] whatever
[12:59.12] and that's exactly what's going to
[13:00.16] happen here today
[13:04.24] we're not going to need to solve 10
[13:05.76] thank goodness uh
[13:07.60] because of homogeneity and isotropic
[13:11.52] isotropy
[13:16.64] we're going to get away with a lot less
[13:27.36] it turns out only two equations are in
[13:29.68] fact independent anyway
[13:42.24] and the argument for this is
[13:48.08] well note the following right
[13:52.88] the the vectors which you get by
[13:54.56] contracting the einstein
[13:56.16] tensor against the ub the tangent vector
[13:58.96] going in the of the isotropic observer
[14:01.04] and the stress energy tensor with uv
[14:04.88] these have no cannot have spatial
[14:14.84] components
[14:17.04] that's due to isotropy
[14:22.00] and similarly
[14:27.12] if you restrict your attention to sigma
[14:29.60] t
[14:30.40] one of these slices
[14:35.60] then you can make a very similar
[14:42.84] argument
[14:44.80] uh that we made for
[14:48.88] the riemann curvature tensor of h a b
[14:54.00] you know that was the argument involving
[14:56.00] diagonalizing matrices and symmetries
[14:58.32] and and degenerate eigenvalues
[15:03.92] it implies that the the
[15:05.36] three-dimensional einstein
[15:07.12] tensor is proportional to the identity
[15:13.44] otherwise you could select out a
[15:15.12] distinguished vector
[15:21.52] so the off-diagonal terms
[15:30.32] of star they vanish
[15:34.08] so if you recall stars find transvert
[15:37.20] equation with cosmological constant
[15:42.08] and and the diagonal
[15:46.00] space based components
[15:53.12] are equal these are effectively induced
[15:56.08] by the eigenvalues of ga
[15:57.52] these effectively induce the eigenvalues
[15:59.92] and of gab
[16:01.44] on sigma t
[16:10.80] and and of course homogeneity
[16:20.84] implies
[16:23.28] that the space time components vanish
[16:34.88] and so we're left with just two
[16:36.00] independent components from star
[16:50.64] i'm going to write them like this g tao
[16:52.72] tau plus lambda g
[16:54.88] tau tau equals eight pi
[16:58.08] rho let's look up the stress energy
[16:59.76] tensor and the
[17:01.12] the time time or telltale component and
[17:03.28] g star star
[17:04.88] plus lambda g star star equals eight
[17:08.40] pi p
[17:11.60] and uh i got to tell you what the star
[17:14.72] notation means
[17:16.08] and there's g tau tau well g telltale's
[17:18.00] easy to explain right it's just g
[17:19.52] a b where you put in the tangent vector
[17:23.36] of the isotropic observers and g star
[17:26.56] star is just any spatial component that
[17:28.64] you get
[17:29.52] by contracting with
[17:32.88] a unit space like vector
[17:44.72] and what we're going to do is uh well
[17:47.76] we've got to do the calculations still
[17:49.36] where i haven't yet
[17:53.36] completely trivialized this problem
[17:57.04] we've got a system of two two equations
[17:59.52] now
[18:00.80] but the metric is like highly highly
[18:03.12] non-trivially embedded in the einstein
[18:04.96] tensor
[18:06.64] i mean it's explicitly there in the the
[18:08.80] cosmological constant term but the
[18:11.04] in the einstein tensor it's sort of
[18:12.48] buried in a non-linear way
[18:15.60] so to carry out
[18:18.88] the subsequent calculations
[18:25.36] we're going to have to work out the
[18:26.48] dependence of the einstein tensor
[18:29.52] on the metric and to do any
[18:32.88] computation in physics you will need to
[18:34.72] choose a basis and you will need to do
[18:36.40] some hard work
[18:37.92] you can't you know basis free doing
[18:40.80] things basis free and coordinate free
[18:42.56] is wonderful for uh deducing
[18:46.80] logical consequences of statements but
[18:49.20] is hopeless
[18:49.92] for doing any real calculation we want
[18:52.16] to model some
[18:53.20] physical process
[18:58.24] so to actually carry out a calculation
[19:00.00] we're going to need to do some
[19:01.52] calculating so we're going to have to
[19:04.48] obtain the explicit form of our metric
[19:07.52] and it turns out to be rather convenient
[19:10.16] to write the fl
[19:12.24] rw metric in the following form it's
[19:15.12] just a little exercise for you
[19:22.64] and it's in in this way we can
[19:24.32] consistently cope with all three
[19:26.08] possibilities of
[19:27.36] the constant big k
[19:38.08] and uh how do we do that well where
[19:40.64] little k
[19:41.52] equals plus one is corresponding to the
[19:44.08] sphere
[19:46.48] spherical three spherical sections
[19:49.60] k equals naught equals the minkowski
[19:52.16] space
[19:54.32] or flat well not in kopsky but
[19:58.48] flat space sections
[20:01.76] and uh little k equals minus one is the
[20:04.84] hyperboloid
[20:06.00] case
[20:12.88] and we're going to take this this is the
[20:14.64] form of the metric that we're going to
[20:15.84] use in our subsequent calculations in
[20:17.60] the following lectures
[20:19.20] we're going to take this metric we're
[20:20.88] going to calculate the
[20:22.48] associated christopher symbols we're
[20:25.28] going to
[20:25.92] then from the christopher symbols build
[20:28.24] the
[20:28.96] riemann curvature tensor the richie
[20:31.28] tensor the richie scala
[20:33.12] we're going to substitute all these
[20:34.56] functions into
[20:36.40] the two remaining independent components
[20:38.96] of einstein's field equations and we're
[20:40.40] going to arrive at some non-linear
[20:41.84] differential equations which we will
[20:43.12] then solve
[20:44.16] and we will be able to solve them
[20:45.68] remarkably but that is a story
[20:48.24] for the next lecture that's it for today
[20:51.20] thank you
[20:51.76] and goodbye
