[00:00.48] hello and welcome back to introduction
[00:02.00] to general relativity
[00:03.44] in today's lecture we're going to
[00:04.64] continue our discussion of the
[00:06.24] linearized einstein field equations
[00:08.48] and study one of their most striking
[00:10.48] solutions namely gravitational radiation
[00:16.88] in the previous lecture we looked at the
[00:18.40] newtonian limit of
[00:19.92] the linearized einstein field equations
[00:22.80] however in that limit the gravitational
[00:24.80] field
[00:25.36] doesn't really change with time but in
[00:27.68] general relativity
[00:28.80] the gravitational field is a dynamic
[00:30.96] entity and this leads to the possibility
[00:33.60] of gravitational radiation
[00:57.12] just like there is in electrodynamics
[01:00.88] that the field has uh dynamic the field
[01:03.52] is dynamically electromagnetic field and
[01:05.52] has supports
[01:07.04] wave-like solutions so can uh general
[01:10.84] relativity
[01:23.84] and we can already study this at the
[01:25.84] linearized level of approximation
[01:28.64] of and determine such gravitational
[01:32.32] wave solutions
[01:35.36] so we need to some kind of equations to
[01:37.12] get started and we're going to use
[01:39.76] the source free
[01:43.12] equations sorcery linearized equations
[01:47.20] that we introduced two lectures ago
[01:56.08] however
[01:59.52] we're going to work in this particular
[02:01.12] gauge that we also introduced in the
[02:02.72] previous lecture
[02:03.60] whereby
[02:07.20] the divergence of the
[02:10.64] gamma a b line over line metric
[02:13.84] is zero
[02:19.76] and in this according to this gauge
[02:21.92] choice
[02:23.04] then the linearized einstein field
[02:25.28] equations become this extraordinarily
[02:26.96] simple
[02:29.20] set of partial differential equations of
[02:31.36] second order
[02:34.32] so as i just emphasized what i just said
[02:37.12] uh
[02:39.60] this first equation here is the gauge
[02:42.32] fixing
[02:42.75] [Music]
[02:44.08] choice let's say each choice as we'll
[02:46.48] see it doesn't completely determine the
[02:48.84] gauge
[03:06.64] so this condition one doesn't completely
[03:14.08] fix the gauge there's a little bit of
[03:15.52] freedom left just like um
[03:18.80] in the lawrence gauge in electrodynamics
[03:25.68] so we are still free
[03:32.80] to make the following gauge
[03:34.24] transformation
[03:38.56] namely we're allowed to take the this
[03:42.24] perturbed metric and
[03:46.88] make an infinitesimal diviomorphism
[03:49.20] generated by the vector field psi
[03:50.88] a
[03:54.00] as long as condition three for today
[03:58.24] this vector field
[04:01.52] obeys this equation here so as long as
[04:03.76] the vector field obeys
[04:05.12] this uh delimition equation here
[04:08.56] then uh equation three then there's a t
[04:11.60] we could still able to make a little bit
[04:13.20] more gauge um
[04:14.59] [Music]
[04:15.92] we still have a little bit more gauge
[04:17.36] freedom left and we can
[04:18.96] exploit that actually to simplify things
[04:21.76] in a moment
[04:22.72] and you'll see that equation three or
[04:25.04] the the gauge
[04:25.92] transformation determined by equation
[04:27.28] three doesn't affect the gauge choice
[04:29.76] specified by equation one
[04:34.64] so we're going to use this this freedom
[04:36.00] now to make our life a little bit easier
[04:37.92] in looking for gravitational
[04:39.44] wave solutions
[04:42.64] we're going to introduce the so-called
[04:44.56] radiation gauge
[04:48.08] which will be quite handy in a minute so
[04:51.52] the radiation gauge is determined by
[04:54.00] the following conditions then the gamma
[04:56.24] is zero
[04:58.56] and gamma naught j component is also
[05:01.52] zero for j
[05:02.48] equals one two three and
[05:05.52] uh gamma itself is just the trace of
[05:07.92] gamma right
[05:17.28] now it turns out that
[05:21.52] if the stress energy tensor isn't just
[05:23.36] zero in a region but actually zero
[05:25.12] everywhere
[05:29.44] and we can achieve a slightly stronger
[05:31.52] gauge fixing
[05:35.28] so if the stress energy tends to zero
[05:37.36] throughout the entire universe there's
[05:38.96] no stress energy
[05:40.08] at what whatsoever
[05:47.60] then we can further achieve
[05:51.28] the condition
[05:54.72] that gamma naught naught is separately
[05:56.72] zero
[05:59.76] so to we haven't got to the radiation
[06:01.76] gauge yet we have to actually find a
[06:03.44] vector field psi
[06:04.48] a that can bring us into this radiation
[06:06.72] gauge
[06:18.32] and the way we find our size we simply
[06:20.56] substituting
[06:22.32] in this gauge fixing condition here we
[06:24.80] simply substitute that in
[06:27.20] to these equations down here for the
[06:29.76] radiation gauge
[06:31.04] and then we solve
[06:44.32] and we have to solve the following
[06:45.84] equations somewhere
[07:00.08] on a fixed initial
[07:04.32] surface t is t naught so you pick some t
[07:07.28] sometime
[07:08.16] in the global initial coordinate system
[07:10.48] and you solve
[07:11.36] these following equations for x i
[07:14.88] so here they are they're just
[07:18.48] it's hardly worth calling this an
[07:20.96] exercise
[07:25.20] it really is just the equations
[07:28.48] fix i determined by substituting the
[07:30.96] gauge transformation equation
[07:34.16] into the gauge can fixing conditions
[07:39.44] it may look a little complicated but
[07:41.04] it's nothing more than what i've just
[07:42.24] said and also
[07:43.36] we are further this is the
[07:48.16] we take the time derivative of the
[07:58.16] previous equation so this equation that
[07:59.84] i'm just writing out here is just the
[08:00.96] time derivative of the previous equation
[08:02.96] however this becomes extremely uh
[08:04.96] important for fixing gauge
[08:06.80] the radiation gauge throughout time
[08:08.48] because if you demand this equation is
[08:09.84] solved then the gauge doesn't change
[08:25.44] and this final equation
[08:28.80] is nothing but this third equation
[08:33.52] where we've taken the time derivative an
[08:35.92] additional time derivative
[08:50.56] so this is an initial value problem we
[08:52.84] have
[08:55.68] it gives some initial values
[08:59.44] for uh x i mu and their time derivatives
[09:03.28] and then we solve them
[09:04.56] so it's an initial value problem
[09:14.08] so given psi mu on
[09:18.00] and its time derivatives
[09:21.44] on the time initial time surface
[09:24.56] we solve
[09:29.92] for psi mu throughout space time
[09:36.08] um and one then has
[09:40.32] which is an exercise
[09:44.00] that uh not only is gamma equal naught
[09:47.84] and gamma naught j equal naught but we
[09:50.48] on the initial time
[09:51.68] surface but throughout space time
[09:57.04] or to be more precise in the source free
[09:59.44] region
[10:01.04] the minute you get to a region where
[10:02.40] there are sources then this is going to
[10:04.32] look valid
[10:10.40] so if tab equals zero everywhere
[10:15.20] we can ensure this additional gauge
[10:17.20] condition 3 that i mentioned
[10:18.96] earlier namely the gamma naught naught
[10:22.16] sorry not 3 but
[10:25.20] i haven't named it actually so we can
[10:30.84] achieve
[10:33.28] gamma naught naught equals 0 everywhere
[10:36.40] as follows
[10:44.84] namely
[10:48.56] we note that um gamma equals naught
[10:51.44] implies that gamma naught
[10:53.44] b bar equals gamma naught b that's the
[10:56.48] first step
[11:03.60] and then equation one then
[11:07.04] tells us that the time derivative of
[11:09.68] gamma naught naught
[11:11.52] is automatically zero and then
[11:16.32] well we solve
[11:22.56] the linearized einstein's equations
[11:38.16] and they tell us that gamma the
[11:39.92] laplacian squared of gamma naught naught
[11:41.76] is minus 16 pi
[11:43.60] t naught naught naught which is zero but
[11:46.32] that tells us
[11:47.44] we there's only one globally valid
[11:49.28] solution to that equation and that is
[11:50.96] that
[11:51.28] uh gamma naught naught is a constant
[11:55.60] and we can shift
[12:01.68] shift uh gamma naught naught by that
[12:04.08] constant
[12:08.16] and that that doesn't end contradict any
[12:10.32] previous equations
[12:16.40] so we can assume further the gamma
[12:18.24] naught naught is constant only in the
[12:19.76] case where the entire universe is devoid
[12:21.84] of matter
[12:24.00] okay well now we've got we've i've
[12:26.00] managed to convince you i hope that
[12:27.84] the radiation gauge where gamma zero and
[12:30.72] gamma r j equals zero
[12:32.56] uh can be achieved by a very specific
[12:35.28] judicious choice of
[12:37.68] the theomorphism generated by vector
[12:39.12] field psi now
[12:41.20] let's try and find some waves
[12:54.16] and the way we find waves is the way we
[12:56.00] always find waves so we assume
[12:58.00] that the dynamical object that we
[13:00.08] currently have namely the perturbation
[13:01.92] to the metric gamma a b
[13:04.16] has the form of some constants
[13:07.04] multiplied by e to the i
[13:09.76] uh times by some
[13:14.00] wave vector dot product with the
[13:17.04] position so we just make a wave unzips
[13:32.08] and we substitute it into the linear iso
[13:36.16] linearized einstein equations so that's
[13:38.48] our assumption
[13:39.44] that we have a wave and then we're going
[13:41.28] to substitute that into linearized
[13:42.64] einstein's equations and hope that we
[13:44.80] well find a wave
[13:58.96] so substituting into linearized einstein
[14:00.88] equations which i
[14:02.16] believe are labeled one today well okay
[14:05.04] firstly the gauge condition
[14:06.96] so one and also four
[14:17.84] oops sorry let's not
[14:20.88] get ahead of ourselves let's first
[14:22.64] substitute into two which is the
[14:24.16] linearization equations
[14:26.00] uh what does that tell us all that tells
[14:27.76] us that
[14:32.72] k mu k mu is zero okay so
[14:36.24] null another vector
[14:44.64] and equations one and four require the
[14:48.08] following conditions to be solved
[14:50.24] so we've got that equations one brings
[14:53.44] down
[14:54.00] one factor of k
[14:59.60] our equation four
[15:03.36] forces h naught nu to be zero
[15:06.56] and also
[15:09.60] the trace condition being vanishing
[15:12.32] requires that h
[15:13.12] mu mu is zero now we've got a whole
[15:16.32] bunch of equations here
[15:17.44] right we've got uh one
[15:21.36] plus four so that's five equations plus
[15:23.52] four is nine
[15:24.88] plus another one is 10 equations see
[15:28.56] so we have 10 equations that need to be
[15:30.48] solved in order for this wavelike
[15:32.40] solution to be a solution
[15:35.60] but only eight equations are actually
[15:40.80] independent
[15:47.92] because a and b imply
[15:52.84] um
[15:59.84] that
[16:07.04] well a and b together imply that h
[16:09.44] naught nu
[16:10.32] k nu is zero
[16:16.96] and that should tell us
[16:20.32] ah yeah together they imply the same
[16:22.32] equation so that's why
[16:28.00] that's why they're not independent
[16:31.44] so nb both imply
[16:36.72] h naught nu k new equals zero
[16:40.96] so only eight equations are actually
[16:42.40] independent of these ten equations
[16:45.04] and now uh what's well what have we got
[16:47.68] to
[16:48.16] to to solve for how many degrees of
[16:50.40] freedom do we have left
[16:51.44] well a symmetric uh tensor of type two
[16:55.44] zero two
[16:58.96] has how many degrees of freedom well
[17:01.84] it's it's a matrix right with four
[17:04.96] rows and columns and
[17:08.72] it's symmetric so you only have to worry
[17:11.92] about the diagonals they're independent
[17:13.68] four
[17:14.00] plus three upper diagonal seven nine ten
[17:17.76] the other all the other entries are
[17:19.04] completely determined
[17:21.84] so this has only 10 uh
[17:25.04] independent components
[17:30.32] so just this naive variable equation
[17:32.88] count
[17:33.76] leads us to conclude that
[17:37.20] only there are only two
[17:40.24] linearly independent solutions
[17:50.48] for this hiv so there's only two
[17:52.80] linearly independent
[17:55.20] uh wave-like solutions to einstein's
[17:59.76] transferred equations of wave-like form
[18:04.40] but that's that's sort of two is bigger
[18:07.04] than zero
[18:08.00] and uh that's a pretty
[18:12.48] striking prediction of einstein's theory
[18:14.40] that grab the gravitational
[18:15.92] field itself has dynamic wave like
[18:18.00] solutions
[18:19.28] and that's something that's a feature
[18:20.72] that one does not find in the newtonian
[18:22.48] theory
[18:25.52] uh it's worth digressing
[18:28.56] to just talk about lower dimensions
[18:33.20] i think this is particularly interesting
[18:34.72] and highly relevant for investigations
[18:36.80] into quantum gravity at the current time
[18:41.04] does one have uh gravitational
[18:44.40] wave solutions in lower dimensions um
[18:47.92] well we can take a look at two plus one
[18:49.84] dimensions
[18:52.96] here the gauge equation here the if you
[18:55.68] do the count
[18:57.12] the gauge conditions
[19:01.92] uh imply six independent equations
[19:05.84] so if you go through and do exactly the
[19:08.32] same argument
[19:09.44] what i gave as what i gave above
[19:12.80] you only get six independent you get six
[19:16.24] independent equations
[19:18.40] um however
[19:21.52] a uh a type
[19:25.44] zero two tensor in two plus one
[19:28.08] dimensions
[19:29.44] has uh uh six components
[19:34.72] so actually there's no
[19:38.40] degrees of freedom count uh would tell
[19:41.60] us
[19:43.20] that the equations uh
[19:47.36] can't be or can be solved but there are
[19:48.88] no degrees of freedom left over
[19:50.96] and uh therefore one concludes that
[19:53.92] there's actually
[19:54.88] no uh gravitational wave solutions in
[19:56.88] two plus one dimensions
[19:59.04] now it's worth pointing out that we
[20:00.40] could have guessed this already
[20:13.04] uh and the reason is is that the
[20:17.52] the um there's a very interesting little
[20:19.20] argument you can make that tells you
[20:20.96] that the curvature tensor is completely
[20:22.96] determined
[20:23.68] by the curvature scalar and the rigid
[20:25.36] tensor in lower dimensions
[20:32.96] so the the curvature tensor rabcd
[20:36.24] in two plus one dimensions is
[20:39.68] is completely determined by the
[20:40.96] following equation
[20:44.88] involving the metric the ritchie tensor
[20:49.76] and the richie scala
[21:01.28] and so the minute you know the richie
[21:04.00] tensa and the richie scala
[21:06.80] well you know the riemann curvature
[21:09.12] tensor and therefore you know all the
[21:12.88] all the curvature information
[21:16.16] or the local second order coverage
[21:17.60] information about your manifold so in
[21:19.12] two plus one dimensions
[21:20.88] there's actually uh
[21:23.92] no more information that the riemann
[21:25.52] tensor gives you
[21:27.12] that you didn't have before with the
[21:28.84] riemann with the richie tensor
[21:31.36] and the scala
[21:35.20] and uh why why is this well this takes
[21:38.24] us a little bit further
[21:39.60] away from where we're going in this
[21:40.72] lecture but um it's worth explaining why
[21:43.36] it's a good homework problem to go
[21:44.96] through this so this is because you can
[21:47.36] decompose the riemann
[21:49.12] curvature tensor
[21:54.72] you can decompose it in terms of
[22:03.76] of rab r and
[22:07.44] uh a completely trace-free
[22:10.48] tensor called the vial tensor
[22:30.08] and then you note that that
[22:31.84] decomposition the condition for the
[22:33.68] vanish
[22:35.60] this decomposition in two plus one
[22:38.24] dimensions
[22:40.40] you note then that the curve of this
[22:42.48] vial tensor vanishes
[22:44.48] and that leads to that equation that i
[22:46.00] wrote above
[22:48.24] now how much you could convince yourself
[22:50.16] of that would just look at the number of
[22:51.84] independent degrees of freedom at the
[22:53.04] riemann tension just do a count of the
[22:54.72] number of independent degrees of freedom
[22:56.32] and then you will
[22:57.20] quickly convince yourself that there's
[22:58.56] no more information that could be
[23:00.56] added all right that's that's cider
[23:03.76] markers if you're interested in
[23:04.72] following this up
[23:06.84] um so
[23:08.72] uh now why is it that we could have
[23:12.00] guessed
[23:12.72] that there's no gravitational waves in
[23:15.20] uh two plus one dimensions well
[23:17.76] uh take a look at uh
[23:20.96] einstein's field equations or look at
[23:22.64] the vacuum einstein's field equations
[23:27.60] what do they read well they read r a b c
[23:29.68] d minus a half
[23:31.20] g a b times their cheat constant is zero
[23:35.04] well that equation if you contract that
[23:37.92] blah blah blah you quickly conclude that
[23:39.92] r is zero and r a b is zero
[23:44.24] but take a look at this equation this
[23:46.24] condition here we have for the the
[23:48.32] riemann curvature tensor that tells us
[23:50.64] that uh
[23:54.56] r is zero and uh so it was originally
[23:57.12] scalar so the whole riemann curvature
[23:58.88] tends to vanishes so the banishing
[24:01.20] the the vacuum monster transfer
[24:02.48] equations in two plus one dimensions
[24:04.24] already imply the vanishing of the
[24:05.84] riemann curvature tensor
[24:07.76] there are no possible waves like
[24:10.40] solutions to the
[24:11.60] trans-field equations in two plus one
[24:13.76] dimensions
[24:16.80] um well before we move on
[24:20.00] uh i should of course emphasize
[24:22.96] something that you've probably
[24:24.64] no doubt already heard um
[24:27.84] and that is that gravitational waves
[24:31.28] far from being a theoretical possibility
[24:35.36] they are in fact now established observe
[24:38.40] physical phenomena one of the most
[24:39.84] dramatic discoveries
[24:43.92] of modern times was the impact of
[24:46.96] detection of gravitational
[24:49.20] wave or radiation emitted from a binary
[24:52.24] and spiral
[24:53.68] black hole merger and they were detected
[24:58.40] actually in hanover well
[25:01.76] the data was analyzed in hanover
[25:04.88] in germany via in 2015
[25:08.80] by a laser interferometer
[25:15.68] so it's it's impossible to uh
[25:19.44] to talk about gravitational radiation
[25:21.12] without without mentioning
[25:23.44] this most striking and celebrated
[25:26.08] experimental
[25:26.88] discovery in 2015.
[25:31.12] so in the last part of today's lecture i
[25:34.00] want to move on from
[25:35.28] the topic of solving einstein's field
[25:36.96] equations in perturbation theory
[25:38.80] in linear order and i want to move on to
[25:42.64] discussing
[25:43.52] uh full or complete solutions to
[25:46.56] einstein's field equations
[25:48.16] applicable to the entire universe
[25:51.60] so we're going to move now to the topic
[25:55.20] of homogeneous isotropic cosmology
[26:04.64] so our goal in the next couple of
[26:06.32] lectures is to
[26:08.24] real to be as bold as possible we're
[26:10.32] going to try and extend
[26:12.48] uh the domain of applicability of
[26:14.88] einstein's field equations to the entire
[26:16.48] universe we're going to try and make a
[26:17.76] model
[26:18.24] of how we think matter is distributed in
[26:20.32] the universe of stress energy is
[26:21.68] distributed in the universe
[26:22.96] we're going to make a model of this and
[26:24.56] then we're going to try and
[26:26.48] uh solve einstein's field equations now
[26:29.28] obviously we can't do it in the complete
[26:30.64] generality that we uh
[26:32.64] that would describe the entire universe
[26:34.88] um instead we're going to make a couple
[26:36.40] of extraordinarily massive
[26:37.68] simplifications
[26:40.00] and in particular impose lots of
[26:41.84] additional symmetries
[26:43.52] and in the end we'll end up with a
[26:45.68] pretty small set of equations that we
[26:47.28] will be able to solve
[26:49.44] and it's those solutions that that will
[26:51.84] occupy us for a large number of lectures
[26:55.68] so yeah as stated our goal now is to
[26:58.40] solve einstein's equations
[27:00.00] in a case of relevance for the
[27:01.28] description of our universe and this is
[27:02.88] impossible to do
[27:04.80] for an arbitrary matter distribution
[27:07.52] however
[27:08.32] what we can do to make progress is to
[27:10.88] assume a sufficiently
[27:12.16] homogeneous and isotropic distribution
[27:14.32] of matter
[27:16.00] and so that's
[27:20.08] the goal now is so to solve einstein's
[27:22.16] field equations that the gab
[27:24.08] is eight pi tab
[27:28.24] we assume
[27:31.60] a uh sufficiently you know
[27:35.20] you only assume what you need
[27:37.12] sufficiently uh
[27:38.64] homogeneous
[27:42.08] and isotropic
[27:45.36] distribution of matter
[27:57.52] so and then we we will try and find a
[28:00.96] solution so
[28:02.00] this will be highly idealized right you
[28:03.68] know we don't live in the universe with
[28:04.96] an isotropic and modular distribution of
[28:06.88] matter
[28:07.52] but if you kind of zoom out enough right
[28:09.36] and coarse green enough then
[28:11.04] yeah whether a star's there or over
[28:12.80] there it doesn't really matter if you
[28:14.40] average out on
[28:15.92] galactic length scales uh then the
[28:18.40] matters should hopefully start to look
[28:20.24] fairly isotropic
[28:21.36] and homogeneous so what we have to do
[28:25.36] is well to move forward we have to give
[28:28.56] a definition of what we could mean by
[28:30.08] homogeneity and isotropy
[28:32.16] for a manifold a space-time manifold
[28:35.60] so that's our first step
[28:39.04] and where we commence the discussion
[28:41.04] today is in just
[28:43.68] introducing a sufficiently rigorous and
[28:46.40] tractable
[28:47.12] definition of what might be meant by
[28:48.72] homogeneous isotropy
[29:01.76] so let's commence with the condition of
[29:04.32] homogeneity
[29:07.44] what is meant by this
[29:11.12] uh well physically we don't occupy
[29:14.56] a privileged position in the universe
[29:16.32] that's the assumption of homogeneity
[29:18.24] what it
[29:36.88] so that the universe should look the
[29:40.64] same no matter where we are
[30:10.40] that's the assumption of homogeneity
[30:14.08] and then the assumption that's
[30:15.60] assumption one assumption two of
[30:20.84] isotropy
[30:24.96] uh is that there's no preferred
[30:26.40] direction in space
[30:28.96] time space
[30:32.48] there is a pretty preferred direction in
[30:34.16] the time direction right
[30:41.92] there's actually been numerous uh
[30:45.68] observations support assumptions one and
[30:48.16] two
[30:49.04] a they're uh
[30:52.24] obviously not true at the atomic level
[30:54.24] um but they're true at the galactic
[30:55.84] level to a
[30:56.56] fair degree of um approximation
[31:00.32] uh a one of the most compelling
[31:04.72] observations
[31:08.40] concerning isotropy is that of
[31:11.60] the uh isotropy of the cosmic background
[31:16.84] radiation
[31:23.60] and recently there's been some new dark
[31:25.28] matter distribution
[31:27.04] results that certainly go along
[31:31.20] with supporting the notion of isotropy
[31:48.64] oh there's a drop of cosmic
[31:54.16] background
[31:58.84] radiation
[32:01.84] so there's you know some pretty
[32:04.96] compelling evidence that the
[32:06.24] universe should be pretty homogeneous
[32:08.56] and pretty isotropic
[32:10.40] and what we want to do now is make a
[32:12.08] concrete mathematical definition that
[32:14.08] captures these notions and then we're
[32:15.52] going to exploit this definition
[32:17.44] and this to simplify our transfer
[32:19.52] equations to the point where we can find
[32:21.04] an analytic solution to them
[32:25.84] so here we go now with the
[32:27.44] mathematically rigorous or precise
[32:29.20] definition
[32:32.24] that we're going to occupy ourselves
[32:33.92] with the next lectures
[32:35.60] so a space-time manifold m
[32:40.88] is homogeneous
[32:48.32] if there exists
[32:54.72] a one parameter foliation
[33:03.60] of m via hypersurfaces
[33:10.16] sigma t
[33:14.80] such that
[33:20.08] for each t
[33:23.12] and any
[33:26.72] points p and q in this leaf of this
[33:30.64] foliation
[33:31.52] so sigma t
[33:38.88] there exists an isometry of g
[33:44.16] of our metric which takes p to q
[33:59.60] and so you've got to imagine like the
[34:01.20] universe is foliated in these
[34:04.56] the infinite number of these sheets
[34:08.16] that depend on a parameter t
[34:16.16] and if you happen to find yourself on
[34:17.84] one of these sheets down here and the
[34:20.56] point p
[34:21.92] then they always exist in isometry which
[34:25.04] takes
[34:25.68] and and that you have another point that
[34:27.52] you're interested in on this sheet sigma
[34:29.44] t
[34:29.92] then there always exists an isometry
[34:32.40] that takes
[34:33.20] p to q it has to be an isometry not a
[34:36.48] dippy morphs
[34:40.64] now there's a there's one remark worth
[34:42.96] making here
[34:44.16] uh for it
[34:51.36] this is for homogeneity you know yeah
[34:57.28] now that's that's homogeneity now for
[34:59.20] isotropy
[35:01.68] before we even start we got to make a
[35:03.76] comment on
[35:04.88] how many observers will perceive the
[35:07.20] universe as being isotropic
[35:09.52] well imagine the universe is sort of
[35:11.68] filled with
[35:13.20] an isotropic distribution of stress
[35:15.28] energy or matter and mass
[35:17.76] mass energy density then
[35:21.52] imagine there's at least one observer
[35:23.20] who can see the universe as isotropic
[35:25.44] well the claim is there is
[35:27.44] actually no other observer that would
[35:30.56] perceive at that point
[35:33.28] you fix a point and you take a look
[35:34.72] around and there's one observer it's
[35:37.12] supposed to exist at least one observer
[35:39.36] that sees the universe as isotropic well
[35:41.12] the claim is it can exist no other
[35:43.12] observer who sees the universe is
[35:44.56] isotropic at that point
[35:46.16] because any boosted observer will see
[35:48.64] the
[35:49.76] well thanks to length contraction uh
[35:52.88] perceive the background distribution of
[35:55.20] stress energy as being
[35:57.28] concentrated in the directions that are
[36:00.56] perpendicular to the motion of the
[36:02.32] observer and so that is no longer
[36:03.92] isotropic
[36:09.12] so there's only one observer at each
[36:10.84] point
[36:35.44] some boosted observers
[36:43.20] see the background
[36:47.36] distorted
[36:52.08] okay so this is the comment before we
[36:53.60] get into the definition of isotropy
[36:55.12] whatever it is whatever our definition
[36:56.64] will be
[36:57.20] we have to admit that it won't apply to
[36:59.04] all observers only
[37:00.72] one observer at any given point
[37:04.08] so now we come to the definition of
[37:06.84] isotropy
[37:12.96] so we say that a space time m
[37:18.48] is spatially isotropic
[37:30.56] at each point
[37:36.32] if there exists
[37:40.16] a congruence
[37:45.12] of time-like curves
[37:54.32] and each of these timeline curves has a
[37:56.08] tangent
[37:57.84] vector ua
[38:02.80] and these time-like curves must fill m
[38:10.96] and they must have a further property
[38:15.12] that for all p in in space-time manifold
[38:18.80] and any two
[38:25.76] unit spatial tangent vectors so these
[38:28.16] ones are
[38:30.84] space-like
[38:36.72] we'll give them a name s1a and it's 2a
[38:40.08] at the tangent space of the point p and
[38:42.40] space that manifold
[38:44.64] so you know what we're thinking of here
[38:46.40] is we have an observer at a point p
[38:48.00] and you pick two directions
[38:51.52] pointing often to yonder
[38:55.44] and you look at space along those
[38:58.84] directions and
[39:00.24] you would say that space is isotropic
[39:03.60] um if there exists
[39:10.40] a isometry
[39:19.20] of our metric which leaves
[39:25.44] our observation point invariant
[39:28.72] and also the time like
[39:32.72] vector unit vector invariant
[39:41.68] but it takes
[39:46.00] s1a to s2a
[39:50.88] these two vectors are orthogonal to you
[40:01.20] okay and so hopefully this is
[40:04.40] intuitively clear
[40:05.44] if if space-time is isotropic with
[40:08.00] respect to the correct observer at the
[40:09.52] point p
[40:10.32] then no matter where you look it's going
[40:11.68] to look exactly the same and so if you
[40:13.68] pick any two
[40:14.72] vectors that point off in a space like
[40:18.48] direction
[40:20.56] then because it doesn't matter which way
[40:22.32] you look you can rotate one to the other
[40:24.48] and
[40:25.12] that would environ isometry so you don't
[40:28.16] change the metric when you do that
[40:34.32] so there's a further a mark that one can
[40:38.08] make
[40:38.48] when you combine the conditions of
[40:41.52] homogeneity
[40:42.48] and isotropy
[40:56.32] so for a homogeneous and isotropic spec
[40:58.40] space time
[41:01.76] these surfaces foliating
[41:05.52] space time
[41:13.68] they must be
[41:17.36] everywhere orthogonal
[41:22.00] to these tangent vectors of the time
[41:24.32] like vectors
[41:26.08] that are this congruence of time like
[41:28.32] curves going through
[41:29.44] the the uh the manifold
[41:35.84] and uh you can convince yourself why why
[41:37.68] that must be the case because if there
[41:39.36] wasn't for example then there would
[41:40.80] exist a point p
[41:42.00] where uh
[41:45.84] you could pick a geometrically preferred
[41:48.32] spatial vector
[41:49.60] and that would violate isotropy
[41:52.64] so i just want to draw a picture before
[41:54.00] we finish for today that
[41:55.92] summarizes both isotropy
[42:00.84] and homogeneity into one picture
[42:05.12] so here i've drawn the surfaces sigma t
[42:08.64] exfoliating space time and then there's
[42:11.52] this congruence
[42:13.20] of time-like curves
[42:17.44] going through space-time going through
[42:20.00] each of these leaves
[42:25.12] and homogeneity is that result that says
[42:28.56] if you've got two points on the same
[42:30.16] leaf
[42:31.12] the same site t there exists an isometry
[42:34.80] of the metric which takes p to q and
[42:38.40] if you're
[42:42.64] in one of these leaves and you have
[42:46.72] one space like vector and another space
[42:48.48] like vector that
[42:49.84] are both orthogonal to ua
[42:56.48] then there exists an isometry which
[42:58.96] rotates
[42:59.84] uh s1 a into s2a
[43:05.52] so that's the notions of isotropy and
[43:07.44] homogeneity
[43:08.56] for a spacetime manifold we're going to
[43:11.20] use these notions
[43:12.48] to highly simplify einstein's field
[43:14.80] equations
[43:15.76] and then eventually solve einstein's
[43:17.84] field equations
[43:19.20] uh you know in a highly restricted
[43:22.00] setting
[43:22.96] where these symmetries are present but
[43:25.12] that's the goal for the next lecture
[43:27.20] for today we're now finished thank you
[43:29.20] very much and see you next time
[43:30.96] goodbye
