[00:00.32] hello and welcome back to introduction
[00:01.92] to general relativity in the previous
[00:03.76] lecture
[00:04.24] we introduced and discussed geodesics
[00:06.88] today the objective is to also
[00:08.64] talk about geodesics and provide a
[00:10.40] second characterization
[00:11.76] which is perhaps more intuitive of what
[00:14.24] a geodesic is
[00:15.36] on an arbitrary manifold after that
[00:17.92] we're going to use
[00:19.20] our discussion of parallel transport to
[00:22.00] introduce a notion or intrinsic notion
[00:24.00] of curvature of manifolds but first to
[00:28.84] geodesics
[00:30.48] suppose we have a manifold m
[00:37.68] and we have two points on m
[00:40.72] and we also have a derivative
[00:44.24] operator associated to m
[00:48.32] then we can associate to any
[00:51.52] two points and any derivative operator
[00:54.80] in a manifold a length
[00:57.84] of the curve that joins these two points
[01:00.00] so we imagine we have some curve
[01:02.00] here that joins the two points
[01:05.28] we'll call the two points p and q
[01:10.96] and we can associate to such a curve a
[01:14.08] length of course we need a metric
[01:17.44] so the data of a derivative operator is
[01:19.36] roughly speaking equivalent to the data
[01:20.80] of a metric
[01:22.08] but let's be explicit here
[01:26.96] so we have ourselves a curve let's call
[01:30.80] it c
[01:32.40] we have two points p q we have a metric
[01:34.48] we have a derivative operator we have a
[01:35.84] manifold
[01:36.88] and we can introduce the length
[01:40.96] of the curve c
[01:45.12] discussed previously
[01:49.84] intuitively in previous lectures so the
[01:52.72] length of c
[01:56.00] with respect to g a b
[02:00.72] delta a is just defined
[02:05.44] to be the following expression you
[02:07.76] integrate
[02:09.28] over the length of the curve the inner
[02:12.40] product between the two tangent vectors
[02:14.48] between the tangent vector to the curve
[02:17.20] along the length of the curve
[02:22.64] so t a here is the tangent
[02:26.08] curve to c
[02:29.36] and t is the curve parameter
[02:36.24] i'll draw on the picture here the
[02:38.24] tangent vector so
[02:39.44] to any point on the curve we have a
[02:40.96] tangent vector t a
[02:42.88] introduced introduced way back
[02:45.92] in the earlier lectures and also
[02:49.20] we assume just
[02:53.04] that our metric can't just have any
[02:56.24] metric for this expression to be well
[02:57.60] defined
[02:58.32] we assume that our metric gab has
[03:02.84] signature
[03:04.96] so when you diagonalize it as a matrix
[03:06.80] you always get plus
[03:08.08] positive eigenvalues
[03:12.80] so implicit here now explicit is that
[03:15.44] the
[03:15.92] metric has positive signature
[03:19.12] so we can define this length right
[03:21.28] there's no no particular problems in
[03:22.80] defining this quantity
[03:25.68] it's the just integrate
[03:28.96] infinitesimal lengths along the curve so
[03:32.08] you've got to imagine that you have this
[03:33.20] curve
[03:34.16] c and you divide it up into little
[03:36.48] pieces
[03:38.32] you approximate each piece with a line
[03:40.00] segment and then you use the
[03:41.84] corresponding tangent vector
[03:43.36] as the the linear approximant to the
[03:45.20] curve then you calculate the
[03:47.20] length of the tangent vector which is a
[03:49.60] proxy for
[03:50.40] the line segment and then you add them
[03:52.48] all up and then you take the limit as
[03:54.00] you
[03:54.32] subdivide your curve into little smaller
[03:56.24] smaller pieces and then you have an
[03:57.84] expression for the length
[03:59.04] hopefully this expression is intuitively
[04:00.88] clear
[04:02.96] so we can introduce this quantity uh
[04:06.00] and what about for metrics a positive
[04:08.48] signature
[04:09.68] so in general relativity of course
[04:13.12] our metric doesn't have positive
[04:14.48] signature not always
[04:16.24] um so for a metric with signature
[04:23.36] we say minus one plus plus
[04:27.36] plus we have to be a little bit more
[04:29.76] creative with how we
[04:30.72] define our our
[04:34.64] our length our curve is said
[04:40.08] to be time like
[04:46.32] if when you compute the inner product of
[04:49.68] the tangent vectors to the curve you get
[04:51.04] a negative number right that's possible
[04:52.72] now the sigma metric has negative
[04:54.84] signature
[04:58.48] if it's negative everywhere along the
[05:00.88] curve
[05:06.16] okay it's time like at that point let's
[05:07.84] say
[05:09.68] but it's got to be this this condition
[05:10.96] is going to be true everywhere along the
[05:12.08] curve
[05:12.80] for the curve to be called time-like and
[05:16.32] we have a different we have two other
[05:18.40] kinds of kinds of curves that you're
[05:19.84] certainly familiar from
[05:21.04] or certainly familiar with from special
[05:23.04] relativity we have null
[05:27.04] curves they're ones where the inner
[05:30.32] product of the tangent vector is exactly
[05:31.92] zero everywhere
[05:36.72] and we also have space like curves
[05:40.64] that's where the inner product is
[05:41.92] positive everywhere
[05:50.64] so your three kinds of curves in in
[05:53.84] manifolds with
[05:54.72] uh laurencian's signature
[05:57.76] minus one and the rest positive or all
[05:59.36] minuses and one
[06:00.88] positive for example so we have these
[06:03.92] three kinds of
[06:05.20] um
[06:11.76] three kinds of special curves right not
[06:14.00] every curve is
[06:15.20] time like not every curve is space like
[06:16.80] not every curve is null it's possible to
[06:19.04] to write down curves in manifolds which
[06:21.92] are sometimes null sometimes
[06:23.92] time like sometimes space like they're
[06:26.80] not physical
[06:28.96] and as we'll see they can't be geodesics
[06:32.40] but we can certainly write them down so
[06:34.32] you've got to understand this definition
[06:35.92] right as not being
[06:37.76] for all curves like it's possible to
[06:39.60] start off with a curve being null
[06:41.04] going space-like and then going
[06:43.28] time-like right i can draw that curve
[06:45.04] but it's
[06:45.60] no particle no solution to the equations
[06:48.08] of motion
[06:49.12] whatever field or or in special
[06:52.24] relativity
[06:53.28] no physical solution can can behave like
[06:55.84] that
[06:56.72] so that's that's a forbidden physically
[06:59.76] forbidden but it's mathematically at
[07:01.36] this point allowed
[07:03.04] there's nothing that says that that's
[07:04.32] wrong um
[07:07.44] so i better for the future notes right
[07:09.68] this is
[07:10.72] unphysical
[07:14.72] and then i'll highlight the portion so
[07:16.40] it commences null
[07:18.40] goes space like and then it goes
[07:21.44] time like
[07:24.72] so time like is green say
[07:28.24] no it's yellow and
[07:31.44] space like is blue it's certainly a
[07:34.56] possible thing
[07:35.28] to happen but as we'll see geodesics
[07:37.52] cannot do that
[07:41.36] and now that we've got these three
[07:42.96] notions of
[07:44.40] um of infinitesimal length
[07:47.76] we're going to have to slightly expand
[07:49.92] generalize or update our definition of
[07:51.60] the length of the curve right because
[07:53.28] okay the length of the curve still that
[07:54.88] definition here still makes sense
[07:58.16] when you have a null curve or a space
[07:59.92] like curve in
[08:02.08] you know lorenz you know kovskin setting
[08:04.40] but if you had a timeline curve so
[08:06.48] that's everywhere negative you can't
[08:07.52] take the square root of it or if you did
[08:08.80] you get an imaginary number um which is
[08:12.56] you know you can certainly go that route
[08:14.88] we're not going to do that though in
[08:16.00] this lecture course
[08:17.04] instead we're just going to say suppose
[08:18.80] we have a timeline curve
[08:26.16] you have a timeline of c well we define
[08:33.52] instead of the length we call it the
[08:35.28] proper time
[08:41.52] so if you have a timeline curve then
[08:43.28] instead of defining the length
[08:47.12] of the geodesic you define the proper
[08:50.08] time of the geodesic
[08:51.28] well not g does it curve although of
[08:53.92] course it will apply to geodesics
[08:58.56] okay so now we have a definition that
[09:02.32] covers
[09:03.68] all the cases that we're going to
[09:06.56] encounter in the world of geodesics
[09:11.36] and oh yeah a side comment of course i
[09:13.84] implicitly
[09:16.48] implied this earlier but now let's say
[09:18.00] it clearly so if a curve
[09:21.12] c changes
[09:25.36] from e g
[09:28.56] time like to null or time like to space
[09:32.00] like right that's where we're gonna have
[09:33.36] real problems um
[09:36.64] the length this implies the length is
[09:38.48] just not defined
[09:42.48] you can have fun trying to define a
[09:43.92] length but we are just going to say it
[09:45.68] is hereby not defined if the curve
[09:47.76] changes from time like to space like
[09:51.04] that's the particularly problematic
[09:52.40] transition
[09:55.92] and now we'll take a look at geodesics
[09:58.48] this is the context of geodesics
[10:00.80] we've already introduced geodesics in
[10:02.16] the previous lecture so we can certainly
[10:03.36] discuss the length of a geodesic
[10:05.52] and what i'm going to argue in the
[10:07.12] coming
[10:08.56] next portion of the lecture is that a
[10:10.24] geodesic has a very
[10:11.92] uh the length of a geodesic enjoys a
[10:14.48] very special property so that's the
[10:16.00] objective now
[10:17.36] but before we quite get to that argument
[10:19.20] and you want to make some simpler
[10:20.72] observations
[10:22.08] so since for a geodesic
[10:27.60] the tangent vector
[10:39.68] it to the curve is parallel transported
[10:42.80] along itself
[11:00.64] now we learned that its norm can't
[11:02.48] change right
[11:06.16] the norm being the inner product of the
[11:08.08] two of the tangent vectors itself which
[11:10.40] is also known as just the metric
[11:14.96] contracted
[11:25.04] and what does that mean well i it it's a
[11:27.76] basically
[11:28.24] proof of uh the statement i just made
[11:31.20] earlier that as
[11:32.40] it cannot change
[11:35.84] from null to time like
[11:41.60] et cetera right you can't change a g
[11:43.36] does it at time like you does it can't
[11:45.52] change to being a space like one and so
[11:47.12] on and so forth
[11:49.52] and uh how can you convince yourself
[11:54.40] that the norm doesn't change well just
[11:56.88] take the derivative of
[11:58.00] it right so that if you want to you know
[12:01.12] why why does the norm not change
[12:04.88] uh when we parallel transport a tangent
[12:07.84] vector along itself
[12:09.60] so let's just do a side computation
[12:12.40] right
[12:12.96] change in norm well
[12:16.80] the change in the norm along the curve
[12:21.36] is the directional derivative
[12:24.80] of the norm we've got to take the
[12:26.96] derivative of the norm as we go along
[12:28.80] the curve
[12:29.84] but now let's substitute our expression
[12:31.36] for the norm so it's
[12:33.12] tb delta b and then we get
[12:36.24] g a b g-a-b-t-a-t-b
[12:39.60] and then we apply the leibniz rule so
[12:41.52] eventually you know you'll get pretty
[12:42.88] good at these kind of computations
[12:52.32] then you get g a b t b delta b
[12:55.84] t a and you get a tb here
[12:59.52] oh yeah i okay i hope it was kind of
[13:04.84] clear
[13:08.80] i should have not used the same index
[13:10.72] here
[13:12.32] so let's do c's and then
[13:16.08] put c's here as well
[13:21.36] and then there's a third term t
[13:24.48] a delta oops tc
[13:32.24] so if you look at this actually all
[13:33.44] three terms of that niche right because
[13:35.20] the first one vanishes because that's
[13:36.80] one of the the defining properties of
[13:38.64] the derivative operator associated to a
[13:40.48] metric
[13:41.04] meaning that the the derivative of the
[13:44.08] metric itself is zero
[13:45.44] and now look at this this term vanishes
[13:47.20] here because ta is parallel transported
[13:49.12] along itself and the same goes for this
[13:50.48] argument here so that's why
[13:52.88] when you parallel transport the tangent
[13:55.84] vector
[13:56.32] along of a curve along with the curve
[13:59.60] the norm of the tangent vector cannot
[14:02.16] change and when it normally cannot
[14:03.36] change it can't change from being
[14:04.64] analogy it is a
[14:05.68] to a time like it is equal to a space
[14:08.40] like geodesic
[14:12.00] now you might worry justifiably worry
[14:14.32] that the definition of the proper time
[14:17.12] or of the length might be
[14:20.48] might actually be um parameter
[14:24.80] dependent right that would be kind of
[14:26.08] stupid if if the
[14:28.08] the the parameter we chose to specify
[14:30.80] where we are along the curve
[14:31.92] if our length depends on that parameter
[14:34.72] then
[14:35.52] that means that it depends on what mood
[14:37.12] we were in on that day when we chose our
[14:38.80] parametrization
[14:40.08] turns out this is not the case of course
[14:42.32] um
[14:43.36] and i'll just give a brief argument why
[14:45.12] before moving to
[14:46.88] connecting geodesics to lengths so
[14:50.24] l and tau
[14:53.36] are re-parametrization
[14:59.36] invariant
[15:06.52] parameterization
[15:11.68] invariant they don't change under
[15:15.52] uh our choice of how we parametrize
[15:17.68] where we are along the curve
[15:19.36] so for example suppose we chose
[15:24.64] s of t
[15:30.40] instead of t to parameterize
[15:36.40] our curve
[15:40.48] to parametrize where we are along our
[15:42.32] curve
[15:43.76] then the new tangent vector
[15:50.88] a little exercise for you is
[15:54.08] s a is d t d s
[15:57.84] t a you pretty much have to go to charts
[15:59.68] that's one way to get
[16:01.12] uh convince yourself of this
[16:03.68] transformation law
[16:05.20] and so now the length let's define the
[16:07.84] length
[16:10.64] let's just suppose we have a metric with
[16:12.16] positive signature
[16:14.72] so the length defined with respect to
[16:16.88] this new parameter
[16:18.08] s is well l prime is per definition just
[16:21.12] the integral of the square root of g
[16:22.80] a b s a s b where the s is the new
[16:26.16] tangent vectors
[16:30.40] but uh let's substitute for what we know
[16:34.96] so we know that the new tangent vectors
[16:36.48] are equal to the old tangent vectors
[16:40.08] times by this whatever delay factor t
[16:43.28] dt ds times ds but that's just equal to
[16:46.08] l
[16:46.32] so in fact the length of the curve
[16:48.24] doesn't depend on what kind of parameter
[16:50.08] we felt like choosing to to tell us
[16:52.00] where we are along the curve
[16:57.52] so now now comes the claim right
[17:02.00] this is the the reason we're talking
[17:03.20] about lengths of curves amongst others
[17:05.20] and that is that geodesics uh have a
[17:08.00] very beautiful property nearly they
[17:09.36] extremize
[17:10.80] the length of a curve joining two points
[17:35.52] so that's the claim that we're going to
[17:36.64] investigate now
[17:38.72] we're not going to completely prove it
[17:41.04] but we will investigate the claim
[17:43.84] and to see what we can learn
[17:53.36] once i show you this argument you should
[17:55.60] be content
[17:56.72] to generalize this to the most general
[17:58.72] setting possible
[18:01.20] okay to make this life simple
[18:07.36] we're going to suppose p and q
[18:10.64] are in a common chart
[18:14.56] just so we don't have to keep changing
[18:16.16] coordinates to get from one
[18:18.24] point to the other that would be a bit
[18:19.92] awkward
[18:22.72] so a chart is just a map from m to rn
[18:26.96] and when to make life even simpler we're
[18:29.04] going to assume
[18:31.44] that that c is space-like otherwise we
[18:34.48] have to deal with the
[18:35.52] proper time it's okay doesn't make any
[18:38.72] particular new challenges
[18:41.44] did for us the minus sign in proper time
[18:43.12] yes i did okay do i see a space like
[18:47.20] and then we're just gonna okay we have
[18:48.72] to use a definition for the length
[18:50.80] and i've got to name that definition
[18:52.08] let's call it star from now on
[18:56.88] so then star the length of our
[19:00.56] curve in this case geodesic
[19:04.96] is the integral from a to b of the sum
[19:10.56] g mu u
[19:20.40] so now we're working in a chart and with
[19:22.24] coordinates so
[19:24.96] so c the curve at the point parameter
[19:28.08] value a
[19:28.80] is p and c the curve with the parameter
[19:32.08] value
[19:32.64] b is q
[19:39.76] and because we're working in a
[19:40.88] coordinate chart that the tangent
[19:42.56] vectors now
[19:44.32] in this coordinate chart are dx mu dt
[19:49.44] so it's just the tangent vector from
[19:51.84] before
[19:56.16] now comes uh so i'll draw a little
[19:58.00] picture just so we've got a
[20:01.44] concrete setting in mind here here's m
[20:04.24] here's
[20:04.80] p here's q here's a chart
[20:09.04] draw that with gray here that contains
[20:11.20] them
[20:13.52] and then i'll draw rn underneath
[20:24.56] there's our chart then we'll draw the
[20:27.52] points p and
[20:28.32] q in this coordinate system p is q
[20:32.00] we have a curve that's connecting them
[20:35.68] here's c here's our curve here which is
[20:38.80] a bad picture to draw
[20:40.80] um his c which was our
[20:44.88] potential geodesic
[20:48.48] i think that's all we need right now and
[20:50.40] now the next part of the argument is
[20:51.76] we're going to imagine
[20:53.52] that we vary this curve slightly so
[20:57.28] imagine that instead of
[20:58.56] computing the length for the curve c
[21:02.16] we're going to compute the curve for a
[21:03.52] little variation of that curve so we
[21:06.40] vary the curve away from the end points
[21:08.08] at the endpoints which you leave the
[21:09.12] curve
[21:09.76] alone so let's just consider a new curve
[21:14.24] and compute the length for this new
[21:16.40] curve
[21:22.40] so this is the green curve
[21:27.28] is a variation is an infinitesimal
[21:30.24] variation
[21:42.24] right of psi compose c if we're being
[21:44.56] super proper
[21:45.68] so what does that mean that means that
[21:46.88] the trajectory in our chart
[21:49.28] of our geodesic is actually
[21:53.20] varied to a different trajectory namely
[21:56.48] x mu
[21:57.20] plus some little teeny infinitesimal
[21:59.60] variation which is the thing i've drawn
[22:01.20] in green
[22:04.16] and where just for some where we
[22:07.12] actually
[22:07.76] demand that d x mu
[22:11.52] at the end point so d x mu a equals d
[22:15.04] x mu b we're not going to vary the
[22:18.08] the curve at the end points we're only
[22:19.84] going to vary in the along along the
[22:21.76] length of the curve
[22:24.00] but not at its end points so then you
[22:26.80] can ask the question you know how
[22:29.04] does the length
[22:33.28] of c prime
[22:36.64] of the varied curve
[22:45.04] change if you do a little variation
[22:48.88] in the curve then the length's got to
[22:50.16] change and it'll change to first order
[22:52.00] and so on
[22:52.80] we'll just collect terms to first order
[22:54.88] because we're doing things
[22:55.76] infinitesimally
[22:58.32] infinitesimal just means we work to
[23:00.00] first order
[23:01.76] and then take things so small that the
[23:03.28] second order terms can be made
[23:04.56] arbitrarily small
[23:06.40] so if you com if you substitute now
[23:10.08] the the the new coordinates of the new
[23:12.88] curve
[23:15.20] the varied curve if you substitute those
[23:17.28] into our expression
[23:18.64] for the for the length
[23:23.44] well then you get a new term
[23:26.96] you get a new length right so you put
[23:29.04] this into a length formula length
[23:30.56] depends on
[23:31.44] on the the curve so the length
[23:35.12] if you substitute this new curve this
[23:37.68] varied curve into the length
[23:39.12] the length depends on the new curve
[23:40.56] right but if you expand to first order
[23:42.72] what should happen is you should get the
[23:43.84] length of the original curve
[23:45.52] plus some first order shift in the
[23:47.52] length the length is going to respond to
[23:49.20] the small variation in the length of the
[23:51.20] curve
[23:52.80] and they'll be higher order terms but we
[23:54.40] won't focus on those so what what's the
[23:56.08] the first order shift in the length
[23:57.92] you know how does it change when we
[23:59.28] slightly vary
[24:01.36] how geodesic well
[24:04.48] the answer is
[24:08.64] this you're just going to do some taylor
[24:10.88] expanding and then
[24:12.32] you'll end up with this expression here
[24:19.44] so this is a calculation that
[24:22.72] you will be assumed to be able to do
[24:42.40] it's just the taylor expansion of the
[24:44.72] length formula
[24:45.68] but this is one of these things
[24:48.88] where although it's just a taylor
[24:52.40] expansion
[24:53.60] it can slow you down in your studies if
[24:56.64] you're not able to fluidly just do these
[24:58.56] kinds of calculations so this is just
[25:00.16] really
[25:02.88] you know i could do all the steps for
[25:04.24] you i'm not going to because i'm a
[25:07.04] big believer that you should
[25:11.44] exercise yourself for these little
[25:12.96] calculations
[25:16.08] and uh therefore i'll leave this as an
[25:18.96] exercise
[25:20.64] so this is how the length responds to a
[25:23.60] tiny
[25:24.64] variation of the geodesic
[25:28.24] so to make life
[25:31.28] for us a little bit easier
[25:37.28] let's assume we've chosen a
[25:40.84] parametrization
[25:43.60] where the tangent or the infinitesimal
[25:47.44] norm is actually one
[25:53.68] now can we always do that let's take a
[25:55.36] look so if you go back to here
[25:57.36] note that whenever you re-parameterize
[26:00.16] whenever you re-parameterize
[26:02.64] um
[26:05.92] a curve so you choose a new parameter s
[26:07.92] then the new tangent vector
[26:10.80] can be computed according to this
[26:12.32] formula here where
[26:14.16] we've substituted we've differentiated
[26:17.60] instead of
[26:18.64] with respect to s but with respect to t
[26:20.96] and d t d s
[26:22.00] well s isn't pretty much an arbitrary
[26:24.00] monotonic increasing function right
[26:26.08] s is pretty much allowed to be whatever
[26:27.76] arbitrary monotonic increasing function
[26:29.52] you
[26:29.76] so choose and
[26:32.96] therefore
[26:36.48] i'm going to draw a cartoon of s
[26:42.48] since s is arbitrary monotonic
[26:46.16] increasing function
[26:47.12] then you're able to choose this
[26:50.16] monotonic increasing function
[26:51.60] always at every point along the curve so
[26:54.72] that
[26:55.04] the length of the tangent vector is
[26:57.92] always one
[26:58.96] just so you should convince yourself of
[27:00.72] that fact
[27:02.00] and so that's why we can assume this
[27:03.76] from going forward that just makes life
[27:05.52] easier for us remember
[27:06.56] the length doesn't depend on the
[27:07.76] parameterization we chose so we may as
[27:09.52] well choose a nice one
[27:13.44] now um let's test
[27:16.72] our geodesics special when it comes to
[27:18.96] length so
[27:20.24] extremality what does that mean that
[27:21.84] means that if you compute
[27:23.52] the change in something that change is
[27:25.92] zero
[27:26.56] at a point and the point in this case is
[27:29.12] a curve
[27:29.84] so you've got to remember
[27:34.88] l is a function we're doing variation or
[27:37.44] calculus here is a function
[27:39.68] functional of
[27:42.80] functions right i.e
[27:46.24] curves so l the length is a machine
[27:52.16] you give it a curve and it gives you a
[27:54.72] number
[27:58.88] and so if you give and so the space of
[28:02.40] inputs to the
[28:03.52] machine that is length is the space of
[28:05.84] all curves on a manifold
[28:07.52] or all sufficiently smooth curves on a
[28:09.04] manifold and
[28:12.40] you've got to imagine there's a huge
[28:13.92] infinite dimensional space and l is some
[28:15.84] functional on that infinite dimensional
[28:17.36] space
[28:18.16] and for a given curve that's a point in
[28:21.44] this
[28:21.84] huge infinite dimensional space of all
[28:23.44] curves you can evaluate dl
[28:26.24] and ask does is the variation in the
[28:28.88] length
[28:29.84] zero or not
[28:33.28] and of course
[28:37.68] we're going to discover that for
[28:38.80] geodesics this is the case
[28:40.72] now but we're going to do it sort of
[28:42.24] backwards we're going to say let's
[28:43.68] suppose
[28:44.72] let's just impose extreme melody let's
[28:46.64] suppose that dl is zero
[28:49.28] then when we make this supposition here
[28:55.44] we we set the left-hand side of the
[28:57.28] change in the length to zero
[28:59.68] but that expression
[29:03.84] then leads us to the following equation
[29:06.96] that must be satisfied by the curve
[29:09.36] right not any curve can be has been
[29:11.44] extremely length
[29:13.52] what sort of
[29:18.72] what sort of curves enjoy
[29:22.08] extrema lengths on a manifold
[29:27.28] well you can think it through you know
[29:30.24] you can set the
[29:31.20] left hand side of this variation dl to
[29:33.36] zero and then
[29:35.92] you should conveyor to convince yourself
[29:38.72] that the only way
[29:40.24] that that can vanish that variation in a
[29:43.92] length can vanish is if the following
[29:45.60] equation
[29:46.88] is satisfied
[29:49.92] again little exercise this exercise
[29:52.80] tests your fluidity
[29:54.72] with calculus and tensor manipulations
[30:04.16] there's the the expression i mean if you
[30:06.88] look at the the
[30:08.48] equation for the variation of the length
[30:10.40] you should hopefully convince yourself
[30:12.24] right that um the variation of the
[30:14.64] length
[30:16.24] uh has some derivatives in it and you
[30:17.84] should know about integrating like parts
[30:19.68] to get rid of derivatives of the
[30:21.04] variation and then you try you should
[30:22.56] try and make it true for all variations
[30:26.00] um and then you should end up with the
[30:29.28] equation i've just drawn here so
[30:31.36] i'll actually put that extra melody
[30:33.44] means dl is zero
[30:34.80] for all variations right i didn't really
[30:37.20] say that explicitly but i hope that's
[30:38.56] kind of
[30:39.28] implicitly clear was implicitly clear
[30:42.56] that if you you vary the curve
[30:47.12] the the length is extremal if no matter
[30:49.92] how you vary so for all variations dx
[30:52.64] alpha
[30:53.20] that you get dl equals zero so imposing
[30:55.84] that
[30:56.32] should convince you that the following
[30:58.08] equation is true
[31:00.40] but this is just the geodesic equation
[31:11.84] so if you have a geodesic then certainly
[31:14.64] it extremizes
[31:15.84] the length between two points and if you
[31:18.64] have
[31:19.28] a uh if you want to extreme as the
[31:22.32] length then the curve that
[31:23.68] does that is a geodesic so this is
[31:26.72] an equivalent characterization of
[31:28.08] geodesics one that's potentially
[31:30.24] intuitively nicer
[31:36.64] let's write that out a curve
[31:40.04] extremizes
[31:43.76] the length if and only if
[31:46.96] it is a geodesic
[31:52.56] okay that's pretty cool and there's
[31:55.92] something really
[31:56.80] magical about this and that is that
[31:59.84] let's go back to this picture
[32:02.40] up here now let's go to the one here
[32:06.56] so you've got two points on the manifold
[32:08.96] m and you've got a curve on the manifold
[32:10.96] in
[32:11.60] joining the two points and we just
[32:15.04] concluded that
[32:16.48] if you draw a curve between p and q of
[32:18.96] minimum length
[32:20.72] then it's a geodesic uh it's sorry
[32:24.32] extremal length and this is the this is
[32:25.92] the key point that i do want to get back
[32:27.28] to in a minute
[32:28.64] if the curvy draw between p and q is
[32:30.88] extremal
[32:32.80] then it's a geodesic but a geodesic
[32:35.36] satisfies a local equation
[32:37.68] right you can start at p and
[32:43.20] you can solve for the geodesic that goes
[32:46.24] from p to q as long as you know the
[32:47.76] tangent vector the right tangent vector
[32:49.44] poking out from p
[32:51.52] you can solve for the the whole curve
[32:53.76] locally you know bit by bit
[32:55.60] so somehow the geodesic equation knows
[32:57.60] about the global
[32:59.04] structure of the manifold now
[33:02.08] it's not strictly true right because you
[33:03.36] needed to know that starting tangent
[33:04.88] vector you need to know which direction
[33:06.48] to to
[33:07.04] exit from p so that you'll land on q so
[33:09.92] that
[33:10.24] that's that is implicit in a little bit
[33:12.80] of global information about the manifold
[33:14.56] but it's still
[33:15.52] really striking that a local in
[33:17.68] parameter equation
[33:18.96] the geodesic equation can somehow know
[33:22.88] with very minimal data about the the
[33:25.04] general structure of the manifold around
[33:26.64] the point
[33:27.60] where you're exiting from i still find
[33:29.28] that kind of magical
[33:32.96] so there's some
[33:36.48] neater things to to to to know about
[33:39.20] geodesics
[33:42.48] so you didn't have to use the length you
[33:44.08] know you can extremize not only the
[33:45.68] length to get a geodesic but actually
[33:50.80] you can get the geodesic equation from
[33:52.56] other functionals
[33:59.36] you can get the geodesic equation by
[34:01.20] varying the following lagrangian
[34:26.40] so the following lagrangian so this is
[34:28.16] this the grunge
[34:32.56] is super simple you just take the the
[34:34.96] tangent vectors to the curve and compute
[34:36.96] the
[34:41.52] inner product and by varying
[34:44.56] this lagrangian obviously you have to
[34:48.16] integrate it along
[34:49.44] s or t sorry the curve parameter
[34:53.52] you also get the geodesic equation is
[34:56.24] satisfied so the minimum of the
[34:57.68] extremized
[34:58.64] the extremizer of the length is the same
[35:00.64] as the extremizer of that lagrangian
[35:02.24] there
[35:02.80] and why do we like this um
[35:06.80] because this can this is really useful
[35:08.72] it can be really useful
[35:13.60] because it can give a very efficient way
[35:19.04] to compute some quick to compute
[35:20.72] christopher symbols
[35:29.12] it's one of these little tricks you
[35:30.32] should bear in mind
[35:33.04] so you know how to extremize the
[35:34.48] lagrangian right you need the lagrange
[35:36.16] equations dl
[35:37.28] dx mu minus d dt
[35:44.80] uh d l d
[35:48.08] x whatever d mu d t
[35:52.72] so that's how to extremize a lagrangian
[35:55.36] and that's like a pretty
[35:56.80] you know if you've got the the metric
[35:59.52] and
[36:00.56] you look at that expression then that
[36:02.96] that might be an easier task right
[36:05.28] than going in and just directly
[36:07.12] computing the christopher symbols
[36:11.04] now i want to talk about the word
[36:12.64] extremize versus minimize
[36:14.48] so extremize right this is a really
[36:16.56] important difference
[36:18.64] versus minimize
[36:21.92] so extremizing sounds like minimizing
[36:23.92] but it's very different
[36:25.20] so if you've got a
[36:28.40] function even in one dimensional minute
[36:31.20] function minimization you should see the
[36:32.72] difference
[36:33.44] here's a function
[36:37.12] um this last bit i want to get right so
[36:41.12] it goes up it goes down and then it has
[36:42.96] a
[36:44.80] turning point like that yep
[36:48.32] where are the extrema for this function
[36:51.12] here well the extrema
[36:52.72] is where the function doesn't change
[36:54.48] anymore so this is where df
[36:56.32] equals zero so this is the graph of f
[36:58.64] versus say
[36:59.84] x or t and here's another extreme and
[37:03.44] down here d
[37:04.16] f is zero and here's an extrema here i
[37:06.48] didn't really try
[37:07.36] i didn't really do a good job of drawing
[37:08.88] it but um
[37:14.16] no i didn't do a good job of drawing it
[37:15.76] well let's just let's just stick with
[37:17.60] with the with the even this is enough to
[37:20.64] make the point
[37:21.68] right you have a function like that
[37:25.20] there's two extrema
[37:26.48] only one of them is the minima
[37:29.84] and things can get really bad so you
[37:32.16] think okay i've extremized the function
[37:33.84] therefore i found the minimum no no
[37:35.52] no no right you found a maximum maybe
[37:38.96] or you found a minimum or you may have
[37:40.80] found one of many local minima the
[37:42.88] function could look like that
[37:44.72] and you can have arbitrarily nasty many
[37:48.08] local minima these are all extremas here
[37:49.92] that are drawn
[37:51.76] you could have ended up in one of these
[37:52.96] local minima when you extremize right
[37:54.88] this is
[37:55.36] all these points here satisfy df equals
[37:57.60] zero so
[37:58.64] it's a necessary but not sufficient
[38:00.32] condition to be at a minimum
[38:02.72] to extremize something
[38:07.60] and let's for the specific case of
[38:11.52] laurentian
[38:12.64] manifold so for lorenz
[38:18.88] signature manifolds
[38:22.72] i'll just tell you a little bit about
[38:24.48] what extremal
[38:26.24] curves look like
[38:31.44] so you might think that you found a
[38:33.44] curve with minimum
[38:35.84] time like
[38:47.04] distance
[38:51.52] but note the following
[38:57.84] it turns out that if you've got two
[39:00.64] points that time like separated
[39:04.08] then they may have arbitrarily small
[39:16.16] proper time so proper time
[39:19.52] if you try you can always minimize the
[39:21.20] proper time you bring it down to
[39:22.80] essentially zero always and how does the
[39:25.20] argument go well suppose you have
[39:27.60] two points and the time-like separated
[39:29.68] so pq
[39:31.28] i'm not going to draw the light cone on
[39:32.72] there you just have to imagine
[39:34.56] that the time-lapse separated okay
[39:36.40] here's a curve that joins p and q
[39:38.88] that's going to have a non-zero proper
[39:40.96] time this curve
[39:43.20] but look at this radical curve i'm about
[39:45.60] to draw here
[39:46.40] this is also a curve joining p and q and
[39:49.12] it's
[39:49.68] it's uh it's physical
[39:53.36] it's nearly null and then it flips
[39:55.60] around to pointing nearly at the speed
[39:57.68] of light here
[39:58.64] and then goes flips around to going
[40:00.40] nearly the speed of light here and then
[40:01.68] goes up and
[40:02.24] goes nearly the speed of light here that
[40:03.52] actually has a lower proper time
[40:06.32] because along these nearly null segments
[40:08.56] the proper time is arbitrarily small
[40:10.32] here
[40:11.12] here and here so
[40:14.48] this gray curve has
[40:18.08] arbitrarily has smaller proper time
[40:24.80] so beware of thinking of proper of the
[40:28.08] proper time as somehow measuring the
[40:30.00] length of the
[40:30.88] nice smooth geodesic curves that
[40:34.64] lower the make the proper time lower can
[40:36.48] be made quite
[40:37.68] nasty by making them nearly the speed of
[40:40.80] light
[40:44.08] so i'm not going to prove that statement
[40:46.80] it's just an observation that you'll
[40:48.48] have to believe or
[40:50.72] investigate yourself so what what do you
[40:53.52] get
[40:53.92] when you you compute the geodesic
[40:55.92] equation for a time-like curve
[40:58.80] so a time-like curve is a geodesic
[41:03.52] if it has the greatest possible time
[41:12.32] oh sorry i said it the wrong way around
[41:14.72] so if a curve
[41:16.24] has of greatest proper time exists that
[41:20.16] extremizes the proper time right because
[41:22.48] it's the greatest the greatest means
[41:24.00] that any variation can't get bigger
[41:26.83] [Music]
[41:27.92] it must be a time like geodesic
[41:43.84] because of this very simple
[41:45.76] one-dimensional calculus commentary
[41:47.60] above
[41:48.88] just because a you have a geodesic
[41:51.12] doesn't mean that
[41:52.16] it is the curve with the greatest proper
[42:00.84] time
[42:03.04] so the any if you have a g s geodesic
[42:06.24] that goes from p to q
[42:08.32] it need not maximize the proper time
[42:29.20] okay that's just some warnings about
[42:31.76] variation of calculus and maximizing and
[42:33.84] minimizing things
[42:35.44] be careful about thinking that
[42:39.04] extremal points are minima or maxima
[42:43.12] or quite often they're just local minima
[42:44.88] or local maxima
[42:48.40] our next topic is that of curvature of
[42:51.20] manifolds
[42:52.40] so we've now reached the point where
[42:54.00] we've assembled enough mathematical
[42:56.80] foundations to be able to discuss in an
[42:59.28] intrinsic fashion the curvature of a
[43:01.28] manifold
[43:02.48] and this is a key ingredient in
[43:04.32] einstein's general theory of relativity
[43:07.20] so for the next lecture we will
[43:11.28] discuss curvature and i'll give you two
[43:13.44] characterizations of curvature
[43:15.20] that are intrinsic to the manifold don't
[43:17.68] require that we know the embedding
[43:19.68] space in which the manifold lives
[43:22.72] and at the end of the next lecture we'll
[43:25.76] have assembled enough mathematical
[43:28.80] constructions and definitions that we'll
[43:30.32] be able to finally
[43:32.16] move on to discussing einshein's general
[43:34.64] theory of relativity
[43:38.16] so the main observation and i've said it
[43:41.04] enough times
[43:42.56] uh in the past but it's worth
[43:45.04] emphasizing
[43:46.32] because it's such a key ingredient that
[43:49.84] the main characterization of curvature
[43:51.76] that we're going to use is that the path
[43:54.16] that parallel transport may be path
[43:56.88] dependent
[44:01.44] and that the path dependence of parallel
[44:04.48] transport is
[44:05.76] a key intrinsic signature of
[44:08.96] curvature
[44:13.12] so if you parallel transport a vector
[44:18.40] from the tangent space
[44:22.24] at some point p to the tangent space at
[44:25.36] some point
[44:26.08] q then this gives
[44:30.32] an intrinsic right it doesn't depend
[44:32.96] parallel transport doesn't depend and
[44:34.56] vectors don't depend on knowing
[44:36.32] if your manifold is embedded in some
[44:37.76] other manifold
[44:40.96] it's an intrinsic proxy or signature
[44:44.96] for curvature of m
[44:50.72] and that's the main the main uh
[44:53.52] observation that
[44:54.72] forms the basis for the remane and
[44:56.64] characterization of curvature of
[44:57.92] manifolds
[44:58.88] so what we're going to do is we're going
[44:59.92] to define a measure of curvature
[45:02.40] like how curved is a manifold as the
[45:05.60] failure we're going to define this
[45:06.80] measure to be the failure of successive
[45:08.16] parallel transporting operations to
[45:10.16] commute
[45:12.00] and that'll define we'll find a way to
[45:14.48] to
[45:15.28] obtain a tensorial quantity so the
[45:18.00] riemann curvature tensor
[45:21.68] is going to be that thing defined by
[45:26.72] the failure
[45:31.36] of successive
[45:36.16] parallel transport operations to commute
[45:48.48] that's how we're going to define the
[45:49.92] riemann curvature we'll find a way to do
[45:51.92] that mathematically
[45:54.48] and we'll do this
[45:57.92] i'm going to do this derivation one time
[46:00.64] with derivative operators and then i'm
[46:02.08] going to
[46:02.56] effectively do the derivation a second
[46:04.08] time with uh successive parallel
[46:05.92] transport operations
[46:07.52] so uh that's the physical intuition that
[46:10.64] lies behind the riemann curvature tensor
[46:12.32] it's the failure of successive parallel
[46:13.76] transport operations the compute the
[46:15.04] actual mathematical definition of the
[46:16.40] riemann curvature tensor
[46:17.84] is in terms of derivative operators the
[46:20.32] way to translate between these two
[46:21.76] definitions
[46:22.96] is to think of parallel
[46:26.24] of parallel transport operations is
[46:28.48] being
[46:29.44] infinitesimal parallel transport
[46:30.88] operations as being one-to-one
[46:32.00] correspondence with derivative operators
[46:34.00] so what we can do is we're going to
[46:37.68] start by studying
[46:44.56] and the action of not one but
[46:48.08] two covering derivative
[46:51.68] derivative operators
[46:56.64] on an arbitrary
[47:01.20] dual vector field
[47:04.96] omega well i know c and
[47:08.80] to make this uh conclusions to bring
[47:12.16] them up the quickest we're going to
[47:13.36] suppose we additionally have a
[47:15.20] arbitrary smooth function f so you
[47:18.00] really got to think of delta a delta b
[47:19.84] as kind of being two infinitesimal
[47:21.68] parallel transports
[47:26.00] so let's consider
[47:32.48] the following expressions delta a
[47:35.76] delta b applied to f omega c
[47:39.36] so if c is a dual vector field then f
[47:41.04] times omega c is the dual vector field
[47:43.44] and we're going to apply we're going to
[47:45.52] try and parallel transport it along
[47:49.20] one vector direction which is indexed by
[47:50.96] slot a and another vector direction
[47:52.88] which
[47:53.20] is indexed by slot b and
[47:56.56] to carry out this computation we just
[47:58.16] use several properties of the
[48:00.96] the derivative operator delta a firstly
[48:03.04] we're going to use the leibniz property
[48:04.56] and the fact that on scalar functions it
[48:06.16] reduces to the normal derivative
[48:15.60] in fact no we're not even going to
[48:16.64] bother using that we're going to use
[48:19.52] adjust the likeness property here in the
[48:21.04] first line and then we just use
[48:22.16] leibniz's property again
[48:24.16] in the second line here
[48:29.60] so we can get four terms depending on
[48:31.28] where this delta operator lands
[48:46.84] okay and
[48:49.84] note that this is this is going to enjoy
[48:53.92] some
[48:54.40] interesting properties in particular the
[48:56.16] first term here because
[48:57.44] we've assumed our derivative operator is
[48:58.88] torsion free we know that delta a delta
[49:00.80] b bf will be the same as delta b delta
[49:02.64] af
[49:05.12] and the the two terms in the middle had
[49:07.84] we done b
[49:08.64] then a well we would have gotten the
[49:10.88] same two terms in the middle
[49:12.32] and in fact the only term that would
[49:15.84] uh between if we change the order of
[49:17.60] these parallel transport operations as
[49:19.12] the last one
[49:20.24] so that's i've already essentially given
[49:22.72] you the proof
[49:24.88] of the next statement the one that
[49:26.16] really will characterize the riemann
[49:27.92] curvature tensor
[49:29.04] let's consider the difference of doing a
[49:31.52] teeny infinitesimal parallel transport
[49:33.52] along the a slot
[49:34.80] vector and the b slot vector the
[49:37.52] difference of doing it one way and the
[49:39.12] other
[49:42.00] well it's a little exercise where i
[49:43.68] basically told you how to do it
[49:45.60] um you know that this is true right
[49:53.28] you see that the difference of these two
[49:54.80] derivative operators when applied to f
[49:56.48] omega c
[49:57.12] is the same as f of these derivative
[49:58.80] operators applied to omega c
[50:00.32] but we've seen that before this kind of
[50:02.32] structure
[50:05.36] um you know we've when we were talking
[50:07.52] about derivative operators we considered
[50:09.44] their actions
[50:10.56] on on scalar functions
[50:14.32] multiplied by dual vector fields and we
[50:16.08] saw that the action of a derivative
[50:17.76] operator commutes with a scalar function
[50:19.52] f
[50:20.24] and then we applied a intermediate mean
[50:22.88] value type
[50:23.68] argument to show that delta a
[50:27.04] omega b depends only on the value of the
[50:30.48] dual vector field at the point
[50:31.92] p under consideration the same reasoning
[50:33.84] applies here
[50:39.44] so since this is true
[50:44.24] for all f we learn that
[50:48.72] delta a delta b minus delta b delta a
[50:52.96] omega c
[50:56.00] only depends
[50:59.92] on the value of
[51:03.52] omega c at the point p where you are
[51:05.44] right that's the key
[51:07.28] consequence of this little computation
[51:11.68] so uh now we learn that the commutator
[51:14.40] of these derivatives
[51:19.52] uh defines a map
[51:26.00] i'll just write it out as a map from
[51:29.12] tenses of type zero one to tenses of
[51:31.36] type
[51:32.40] zero three
[51:37.36] and in other words
[51:40.64] there exists a matrix representation for
[51:42.40] this linear map
[51:51.84] r a b c d which is a tensor of type 1
[51:56.24] 3
[51:59.36] such that for all
[52:02.64] dual fields
[52:06.00] we have the following representation
[52:23.36] and now i've just defined for you the
[52:25.20] riemann curvature tensor
[52:34.24] it does turn out to be tension in this
[52:44.84] case
[52:49.20] so our abcd is something called the
[52:50.96] riemann curvature tensor
[52:52.80] and mathematically you can see it sort
[52:55.52] of
[52:56.40] measures the difference in parallel
[52:59.60] making little infinitesimal parallel
[53:01.20] transports
[53:02.64] along two directions
[53:05.76] now that that intuitive interpretation
[53:08.96] of this mathematical equation can be
[53:10.48] made more precise and that's what we're
[53:11.76] going to do now
[53:15.36] so i'm going to give we're going to i'll
[53:18.40] give a
[53:19.36] argument now to you that will relate
[53:24.24] our abcd to the failure
[53:28.96] of successive parallel transports
[53:42.80] and to do that i'm going to draw for you
[53:45.20] a picture
[53:48.16] to explain this
[53:57.84] so we'll put a slightly orange
[54:02.88] now what you've got to imagine here is
[54:04.64] that we've got a manifold
[54:06.56] m which is this which i've now drawn as
[54:09.60] a three-dimensional
[54:10.72] manifold here m is
[54:17.28] for this for the next part of this
[54:18.56] argument you've got to imagine it's
[54:20.16] important
[54:20.88] that we have you think of the manifold
[54:23.60] as being
[54:24.32] um higher dimensional than just
[54:28.56] uh one so in particular
[54:33.04] it's very important that m in this
[54:36.84] characterization
[54:38.24] looks maybe arbitrary dimensional
[54:45.04] so m here
[54:49.12] is this orange surface sorry orange
[54:52.48] volume right in this in this story and
[54:55.52] then what's going to happen
[54:57.12] is we're going to talk about
[54:58.32] successively parallel transporting a
[55:00.48] vector
[55:02.40] in two different ways so we're going to
[55:05.12] start with some point p
[55:07.20] and p is in a surface
[55:10.24] s it's also in a big manifold here
[55:13.76] and we're going to imagine is we start
[55:15.20] at p and we
[55:17.76] and that there is some two-dimensional
[55:20.32] surface
[55:21.36] s that p lies in as well this is really
[55:24.56] important
[55:26.40] and we're going to parallel transport
[55:27.84] our vector along
[55:30.00] one curve in s along another curviness
[55:32.24] along another one and then back to where
[55:33.76] it started from
[55:40.48] so suppose you have a vector v
[55:46.40] at p and then you parallel transport it
[55:48.72] along like
[55:49.76] one direction in your your
[55:51.36] two-dimensional surface
[55:54.00] and then you parallel transport along
[55:56.56] this next part of a little square that
[55:58.16] you've drawn in your surface
[55:59.76] and then so on your parallel transport
[56:01.52] it back
[56:04.40] and then i don't know at the end of it
[56:05.92] you end up with a new vector v
[56:07.60] prime which is the result
[56:11.76] of having parallel transported your
[56:14.32] vector around this little square
[56:16.00] inside this surface s of dimension
[56:20.16] two so you've got four portions to this
[56:23.20] parallel transport
[56:28.64] depending on where you're going around
[56:30.08] this little square
[56:33.28] and we're going to to make things a
[56:35.76] little bit easier we're going to
[56:36.56] coordinate
[56:37.52] our manifold and say that these portions
[56:39.92] are on
[56:42.40] constant coordinate
[56:47.04] lines so that this little square is
[56:50.08] is in uh
[56:54.72] this little square is
[56:57.76] realized by doing a little
[57:01.12] transports along constant coordinate
[57:03.60] curves
[57:04.48] in the surface s i'll write this out in
[57:06.32] equations in a minute
[57:08.16] so the coordinate of the point p is 0
[57:11.12] zero the coordinate of the first
[57:13.20] point on the journey is zero comma delta
[57:15.12] t so we have two coordinates
[57:21.84] of the surface s now of course m has n
[57:24.72] coordinates but s is a two dimensional
[57:26.48] surface defined by
[57:28.08] by two coordinates just to call them a
[57:30.48] little less little t so this is
[57:32.56] big s
[57:36.72] and the second point on our journey is
[57:39.28] delta s
[57:40.40] delta t i could put deltas in there
[57:44.32] sorry i shouldn't have done that
[57:48.80] uh the second point in our journey is
[57:50.16] delta s delta t the third point in our
[57:52.24] journey is delta s comma zero
[57:54.64] and the starting point is zero zero
[57:58.08] so we take now you see the data what do
[58:00.64] we need to
[58:01.60] you know what what data is required to
[58:03.60] even set up the scenario we need to have
[58:06.24] uh a surface a surface is defined by
[58:08.88] maybe
[58:09.60] two vectors or you can imagine that it's
[58:11.52] a kind of flat surface defined by two
[58:13.20] vectors so
[58:14.24] to even talk about a surface in a
[58:15.76] manifold you need the data of at least
[58:17.20] say two vectors right
[58:20.24] you also need the data of another vector
[58:21.92] v
[58:23.36] that's the vector that's being parallel
[58:24.80] transported around the surface
[58:27.12] and uh you need the metric and you need
[58:30.16] a parallel and your covariant derivative
[58:31.68] operator to talk about this scenario
[58:33.36] here so now let's write out that's the
[58:35.04] picture
[58:35.60] of the scenario i'm now about to
[58:37.28] describe
[58:40.80] so in slightly more precise
[58:45.12] words and equations so we consider a
[58:48.84] loop
[58:52.72] starting at some point p in the manifold
[58:55.44] and this loop is defined
[59:03.04] by a two-dimensional surface
[59:08.96] s
[59:12.16] through p and so the coordinates
[59:16.80] we can choose some coordinates that we
[59:18.64] like for s
[59:23.28] let's just call our coordinate system
[59:24.80] whatever s comma t
[59:29.44] and of course in the picture above i've
[59:31.84] made it clear that the coordinate system
[59:35.20] that the origin of this coordinate
[59:36.48] system is exactly the point p
[59:40.64] then the loop that we're going to
[59:42.80] parallel transport our
[59:44.08] vector around
[59:50.64] is defined by the following four steps
[59:53.20] we start at the point zero zero in
[59:55.04] coordinates on s we go to the location
[59:57.60] zero delta t
[59:59.12] by path parallel transport operation one
[60:01.76] we go to
[60:02.64] the location delta s delta t uh
[60:06.00] by parallel transport two we get
[60:09.04] two delta s comma zero by three
[60:13.36] and then we finally end up at zero zero
[60:15.84] by parallel transport four
[60:20.08] finishing our path
[60:24.64] so to do this parallel transport well
[60:27.28] we're going to need a vector
[60:28.80] so that v be a vector
[60:34.16] an arbitrary vector right not just any
[60:35.84] vector an arbitrary vector
[60:48.56] and we're going to parallel transport it
[60:59.36] around the loop
[61:03.20] and to make the computation a bit easier
[61:07.76] we're going to suppose we have
[61:11.36] an arbitrary
[61:14.88] dual vector field defined everywhere on
[61:18.16] the manifold this is just helpful for
[61:19.76] the computation you don't need it
[61:27.68] what the the the style of argument we're
[61:29.68] going to use is we're going to construct
[61:30.96] a scalar quantity
[61:32.64] and consider that and then parallel
[61:34.40] transport the scalar quantity around and
[61:36.32] it just is easier to do the computation
[61:38.32] then at the end we let omega a be
[61:39.92] arbitrary and cancel it out
[61:42.08] so omega a just plays the role of
[61:43.76] turning of of
[61:46.24] of like an arbitrary test dual vector so
[61:52.08] now can
[61:53.12] to actually do our computation we
[61:55.68] consider
[61:56.72] v a omega a and now that's a scalar
[61:59.36] function
[61:59.84] on the manifold and that makes some
[62:01.28] operations a bit easier to do
[62:04.84] mathematically
[62:06.80] now let's look at the change in this
[62:08.24] scalar function
[62:17.84] along the first part of our little loop
[62:25.20] how is it defined well we're going to
[62:27.12] make an infinitesimal loop
[62:32.16] or i said equivalently we just
[62:34.64] considered things to first order
[62:38.64] and now here's something that may
[62:41.28] through you for a second um
[62:51.68] we're going to evaluate the first order
[62:53.52] change at the midpoint between
[62:56.00] the point where we are where we're going
[62:57.20] to end up
[63:01.76] of now i said first order up to now but
[63:03.68] i lied in fact we're going to do this
[63:05.52] computation to second order this is one
[63:07.04] of these
[63:08.88] uh rare occasions where you do need to
[63:11.04] go to second order
[63:23.04] so evaluating this expression for the
[63:25.84] the change delta 1 in the scalar
[63:27.84] function v
[63:28.40] a omega a if you evaluate that at the
[63:30.48] midpoint you actually get an expression
[63:31.92] that's correct to second order
[63:36.56] even the second order term is correct
[63:39.92] that's a handy trick to know if you want
[63:42.32] if you have to do a calculation that's
[63:43.76] correct
[63:44.40] to second order you could either include
[63:46.48] the second order term and evaluate it at
[63:48.32] the end point
[63:49.20] or you could take just the first order
[63:50.96] term and insert the midpoint here
[63:53.12] it's pretty a neat and handy trick for
[63:56.00] doing calculations the second order that
[63:57.68] you should remember
[63:59.60] so delta 1 is
[64:03.20] big delta t t b d
[64:06.32] delta b v a omega i'm just using the
[64:10.40] fact that on scalar functions
[64:13.12] the derivative operator reduces on
[64:15.52] scalar functions
[64:16.64] to the normal derivative operator
[64:22.24] and then if we just apply leibniz
[64:24.24] property
[64:25.36] and use the fact that va is parallel
[64:27.68] transported
[64:29.52] then we get the following expression
[64:50.96] okay delta one has this expression
[64:55.44] oh i mean maybe not
[64:59.36] i better make it explicit here ta is a
[65:01.52] tangent vector
[65:03.28] it's not a it's the
[65:12.88] is the tangent vector to the curve with
[65:17.20] constant s coordinate
[65:22.24] and parallel transport operation means
[65:24.72] that ta
[65:33.84] yeah so
[65:39.92] similarly
[65:43.36] just do the same argument
[65:50.72] we obtain uh for the change along the
[65:53.84] third part of our journey
[65:58.24] the following expression right on parts
[66:00.64] one and two
[66:01.28] one and three of our journey we're
[66:02.80] changing
[66:04.64] t the t coordinate
[66:09.68] so all the changes between these two
[66:11.28] expressions is where you evaluate them
[66:14.40] namely at the midpoint of these two
[66:17.68] coordinates
[66:24.64] so then what we're going to do is we've
[66:25.92] got two parts of the change
[66:28.08] in our function along our parallel
[66:30.40] transport around the loop
[66:31.84] let's combine them and then i'll leave
[66:33.76] the other two to as an exercise
[66:37.28] it's just going to be an exercise in
[66:38.64] changing esses with tees
[66:47.92] so i'm just going to add them up
[66:49.92] subtract them sorry
[66:51.68] or add up the first term and to the
[66:55.04] inverse of the second term
[67:11.84] and we're going to call this stuff
[67:18.96] later i'm going to give it a name right
[67:20.80] now we're not and we're just going to
[67:22.40] notice one thing about this expression
[67:24.16] right as a function of delta s
[67:26.48] this vanishes as delta s goes to zero
[67:42.48] as it should do right you know if you
[67:44.16] parallel transport along the curve and
[67:45.76] go back the way you came you better get
[67:47.20] zero
[67:54.64] and interestingly
[67:59.76] if you go through the computation and
[68:01.12] work out
[68:04.08] d2 plus d4
[68:12.64] then you see that it goes to zero as
[68:14.40] delta t goes to zero
[68:17.12] so actually what we've learned is that
[68:19.12] parallel transport around the loop is
[68:20.88] path
[68:21.36] independent to first order
[69:01.20] so parallel transport around a loop is
[69:03.04] path independent
[69:10.16] to first order i mean it's definitely
[69:12.08] path dependent it's just path
[69:13.76] independent to first order so the path
[69:17.20] of dependence appears in second order
[69:37.68] so now our goal is to get the path uh
[69:40.24] depend the second order dependence on
[69:42.08] parallel transport to second order
[69:45.12] by explicitly isolating out the second
[69:48.88] order terms
[69:50.40] so to get second order dependence
[69:52.64] consider the parallel
[69:54.00] transport
[69:59.76] of our vector va
[70:04.32] and of a second vector which you can
[70:06.96] define
[70:07.60] a covector dual vector
[70:14.00] along t equals delta t or along
[70:21.68] this is a weird device what we're about
[70:23.12] to use but i'll draw a picture to try
[70:24.56] and
[70:25.12] explain the construction here
[70:30.72] so here's our vector v that we've
[70:33.12] parallel transported up to the midpoint
[70:41.52] and then we're going to parallel
[70:42.40] transport along this dotted line here
[70:57.76] and this dotted line is
[71:01.04] the curve t is delta t over two
[71:04.88] not delta t see
[71:08.00] here's the point delta t zero delta t
[71:10.08] here's the point delta s
[71:11.52] delta t up here here's the coordinate
[71:14.88] zero zero
[71:15.84] so we're parallel transporting va along
[71:17.92] this mid curve
[71:19.28] so we're not going to parallel transport
[71:20.64] it all the way around the loop we're
[71:21.92] just gonna
[71:22.96] send it up to the up to the mid
[71:26.00] curve and we're also going to parallel
[71:28.08] transport this other vector
[71:29.44] this covac dual vector tb omega a along
[71:31.92] the same curve
[71:34.16] um why are we doing that well because if
[71:37.04] you look here at the difference
[71:41.28] delta 1 delta 2 you notice that we're
[71:43.36] evaluating things at midpoints right and
[71:45.20] what we want to do is we want to compute
[71:47.36] the difference between
[71:50.56] these two terms that i've highlighted in
[71:52.24] yellow va is is
[71:54.00] this is of course common here
[71:59.04] so you pull it out as a common factor we
[72:01.44] want to evaluate the difference
[72:02.88] of these two yellow highlighted terms
[72:05.44] and
[72:06.84] well they're evaluated
[72:09.28] at uh different points in the loop
[72:12.64] in fact va although va i said it's
[72:14.64] common of course it isn't right va here
[72:16.40] the second blue one
[72:18.56] is evaluated at the other point in the
[72:21.60] curve
[72:22.72] so but i'm highlighted in green
[72:28.80] so we want to get in order to actually
[72:31.28] compare these two quantities well we
[72:32.72] need to
[72:33.52] evaluate them at the same point and
[72:36.24] here's a trick to doing that so we
[72:37.92] imagine
[72:38.80] we're going to parallel transport the
[72:40.80] yellow dual vector
[72:41.92] yellow highlighted dual vector to the
[72:43.76] midpoint of the
[72:45.36] the part 3 of our parallel transport
[72:49.84] then we'll just mathematically subtract
[72:51.44] them at that point there
[72:57.52] now we've already determined that to
[72:59.76] first order
[73:07.28] the vector v a at delta s
[73:10.64] delta t over 2 is
[73:14.32] equal to v a at
[73:18.80] delta oops at zero delta t
[73:22.48] over two because parallel transport is
[73:25.84] path independent to first order
[73:31.12] so the the only quantity that does
[73:35.60] change along the red dotted curve
[73:42.56] is t t b delta b omega c
[73:47.44] omega a
[73:52.00] so at delta t over 2 it differs
[73:59.44] from the same
[74:02.56] joule vector evaluated
[74:05.68] at delta t oops did it the wrong way
[74:08.48] around here
[74:09.04] put the delta s first
[74:17.92] all right these two quantities
[74:19.20] potentially differ in fact they almost
[74:20.80] certainly differ because omega is an
[74:22.24] arbitrary dual vector field on the loop
[74:27.68] and this quantity differs from yeah
[74:30.56] obviously differs that but it's
[74:31.84] we can't compare these two quantities
[74:33.36] yet there are different places so we
[74:34.48] have to parallel transport them
[74:36.48] so it it also differs
[74:39.68] from this dual vector field parallel
[74:41.92] transported to
[74:43.84] delta s delta t over two
[74:47.28] and how does it differ well
[74:50.88] just go back to your defining properties
[74:54.24] of parallel transport and work out
[74:56.00] that the first order the parallel
[74:57.60] transport
[75:04.32] of the dual vector is given by the
[75:08.84] formula
[75:11.92] the first order is given by uh
[75:13.76] integrating the the equation of motion
[75:16.16] for the parallel transport of a dual
[75:18.08] vector you can do it to first order
[75:21.68] so i'll just leave that as an exercise
[75:26.00] and we're now parallel transporting
[75:27.76] along the constant s
[75:36.84] coordinate
[75:38.24] a concert t sorry
[75:47.76] call the star star
[76:04.84] substituting
[76:06.00] star star
[76:09.04] into the expression for delta 1 plus
[76:11.60] delta 3
[76:14.48] now gives us our desired second order
[76:18.84] dependence
[76:32.84] and similarly for delta two plus delta
[76:37.04] four
[76:46.80] now let's put them all together right we
[76:48.40] need to understand
[76:52.48] what the total change is as we go around
[76:54.80] the whole loop
[76:55.68] of our quantity va
[76:59.12] omega a
[77:03.84] and well exercise
[77:09.76] it turns out that that
[77:12.80] when you add up the change over all
[77:16.40] the four legs of the journey
[77:20.72] that you end up with the following
[77:28.84] expression
[77:34.00] i think i've got a bracket too many
[77:39.68] no looks right
[77:46.72] and now let's rearrange things
[77:55.20] and we'll see that we get quite a
[78:00.00] familiar expression
[78:06.16] namely we get the commutator of these
[78:07.92] two derivative operators applied to the
[78:10.40] dual vector
[78:23.04] now the reason why i could go from the
[78:24.96] first line to the second line
[78:29.04] but i'll get to that in a sec but i want
[78:30.48] to highlight of course that what comes
[78:32.40] out
[78:32.96] is that the the second order dependence
[78:36.32] of the change in parallel transport of
[78:39.20] vector v
[78:40.24] is dependent it is controlled by the
[78:42.80] riemann curvature tensor
[78:46.64] so but how did i go from lines one to
[78:52.84] two
[78:54.80] so here we used the fact
[79:00.48] that for coordinate vector fields that
[79:08.08] the lead record
[79:20.84] vanishes
[79:34.64] which in our case was dds ddt
[79:45.28] so we've learned that this variation
[79:54.24] delta v a omega a
[80:00.00] now is a bit where we cancel off this
[80:01.52] dual vector field it can hold for all
[80:09.44] omega a only
[80:16.84] if
[80:19.20] to first order or in delta s and d delta
[80:22.80] t
[80:23.04] separately or more correctly to second
[80:25.44] order
[80:26.40] in delta s delta delta s
[80:30.24] and delta t uh that the
[80:34.00] variation the the the path the
[80:37.04] difference in the parallel transport of
[80:38.64] delta
[80:39.28] of va around these two legs or around
[80:42.08] the whole loop
[80:43.04] obeys this equation here
[80:48.40] and this gives us our second
[80:50.56] interpretation
[80:52.16] of the riemann curvature tensor you know
[80:54.00] the first was really as a mathematical
[80:55.52] definition the second here
[80:56.96] is as the failure
[81:00.08] of parallel successive parallel
[81:02.32] transformation operations
[81:03.84] to commute
[81:08.08] so this concludes this lecture on
[81:10.80] geodesics
[81:11.76] and the riemann curvature tensor in the
[81:13.28] next lecture we're going to
[81:15.36] continue our discussion of curvature and
[81:17.84] establish a whole bunch
[81:19.04] of properties of the riemann curvature
[81:20.80] tensor we're going to introduce some
[81:22.56] derived quantities
[81:24.16] and we're going to relate in the most
[81:27.20] important consequence
[81:28.88] of uh this discussion we're going to
[81:30.72] relate the green montgomery tensor
[81:32.80] to the divergence of nearby geodesics
[81:35.76] but that's it for now
[81:36.80] thank you and goodbye
