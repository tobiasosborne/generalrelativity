[00:00.64] hello and welcome back to introduction
[00:02.32] to general relativity
[00:03.68] in the previous lecture we left off
[00:06.00] discussing
[00:06.80] linearized gravity that is solutions
[00:09.44] untransferred equations where we
[00:11.68] consider the perturbations in the
[00:13.92] geometry to
[00:15.28] only to linear order in the perturbation
[00:19.28] around a flat space-time solution well
[00:21.44] that's the objective
[00:23.12] in this lecture and in that previous
[00:25.44] lecture we ended off
[00:26.56] discussing diffiomorphisms and
[00:28.40] isometries and the reason we were
[00:30.32] looking at
[00:30.96] this topic was because we wanted to
[00:32.72] understand the gauge freedom of
[00:33.92] einstein's general theory of relativity
[00:35.68] and how we can use it
[00:36.88] to simplify the linearized equations of
[00:39.28] motion that arise
[00:40.72] from linearizing einstein's field
[00:42.40] equations
[00:43.76] so in today's lecture we're going to
[00:45.36] continue our discussion of
[00:46.92] diviomorphisms and isometries and in
[00:49.60] particular look at infinitesimal
[00:51.36] diffumorphisms and isometries and
[00:53.76] show how they can be exploited to
[00:55.52] simplify the linearized einstein's field
[00:57.44] equations
[00:59.76] before that we just have to spend a
[01:01.60] little bit more time discussing
[01:03.20] uh diffumorphisms and the gauge
[01:05.84] structure of general relativity before
[01:07.20] we look at infinitesimal diffumorphisms
[01:10.48] so if we have a diphymorphism
[01:15.60] phi between two manifolds m and n
[01:20.08] then as i emphasized in a very early
[01:22.64] lecture in this course
[01:25.44] the manifolds m and n have identical
[01:29.52] manifold structure
[01:39.04] okay that's just the the in other words
[01:41.28] diffumorphisms are the morphisms in the
[01:43.20] category of smooth manifolds
[01:47.04] and this means that the the topologies
[01:49.12] you get induced on the manifolds
[01:51.84] are equivalent and also the
[01:55.52] the smoothness structures and so on
[02:00.48] now you have to observe that general
[02:03.28] relativity
[02:04.96] describes nature
[02:11.28] in terms of a manifold right
[02:21.04] in terms of a manifold m and
[02:24.08] right there's some additional data it's
[02:25.76] not just that you have a manifold
[02:27.20] structure that encodes
[02:28.40] all of the space time
[02:31.84] you you have some additional tensor
[02:34.84] fields
[02:36.64] in general relativity uh a list of
[02:39.84] tensor fields i've written t
[02:41.52] subscript with j in brackets to indicate
[02:43.60] there's more than one such tensor field
[02:48.24] and the point is that in general
[02:49.68] relativity we don't just have the
[02:50.64] manifold structure of course we have
[02:52.24] uh a couple of tensor fields that are
[02:53.76] highly relevant for einstein's field
[02:55.52] equations the ritchie tensor
[02:57.20] the richie scala the einstein tensor we
[02:59.60] also have the stress energy tensor these
[03:01.12] tenses all play a key
[03:03.52] role in the destruction in the
[03:05.76] description of nature
[03:09.36] so since general relativity describes
[03:11.60] nature in terms of
[03:12.64] of a manifold and some tensor fields
[03:14.88] that write them tj's just a list of
[03:17.12] sensor fields
[03:19.76] then if some manifold and the requisite
[03:23.12] list of appropriate tensors
[03:25.04] fields and another manifold say n
[03:28.64] with a push pulled back
[03:31.92] as appropriate list of tensorfields uh
[03:35.28] have physical identical properties
[03:45.36] there's no if there i'll rewrite that
[03:59.04] so here we are getting into the gauge
[04:00.64] structure of general relativity so if we
[04:02.24] have a manifold with some tensorfields
[04:04.08] on it dj
[04:04.88] then endodymorphism phi then
[04:08.40] the argument is that m and its list of
[04:11.76] tensorfields tj
[04:13.36] and n the image of the diffumorphism and
[04:16.24] the appropriately pushed forward
[04:18.16] uh tensorfields 5 star tj have
[04:20.96] identically physically identical
[04:22.64] properties
[04:23.76] and the reason is
[04:27.84] because this is because right
[04:34.96] uh all operational quantities
[04:43.44] in general relativity
[04:49.44] are built operational means you can
[04:51.36] design an experiment to measure them
[04:53.44] are built from these tensor fields tj
[04:57.36] in a coordinate free manner
[05:08.48] and what does that mean well that means
[05:10.56] that jacobian factors cancel
[05:18.80] under contraction
[05:25.68] tensor operations or tensor
[05:36.84] transformations
[05:40.16] so in this way like
[05:43.76] it's a very simple argument ultimately
[05:46.64] uh
[05:50.84] diffiomorphisms
[05:53.44] comprise
[05:57.28] the gauge freedom of general relativity
[06:10.80] now that's a fairly general argument but
[06:12.80] it doesn't actually help us in the
[06:14.00] discussion we may have now of the
[06:15.84] linearized einstein
[06:17.52] field equations and the reason is is
[06:19.44] that we want a slightly more
[06:21.52] specific uh form of diffiomorphism that
[06:24.96] we want to focus on maybe
[06:25.92] infinitesimally small or
[06:27.52] near identity diffumorphisms and those
[06:29.68] are the ones that we'll use to simplify
[06:30.96] the linearized einstein field equations
[06:33.12] to talk about infinitesimal
[06:34.92] diffumorphisms
[06:42.88] leads us to the topic of the lead
[06:44.64] derivative and
[06:46.00] killing vector fields
[06:59.52] so we're going to introduce some
[07:00.72] additional mathematical infrastructure
[07:02.80] and in order to describe quantitatively
[07:06.32] infinitesimally small
[07:14.84] diphymorphisms
[07:17.36] okay we start as before with a manifold
[07:19.28] m and now
[07:20.88] we suppose we have a not one
[07:23.20] diffumorphism
[07:25.20] but a one parameter group of
[07:28.84] diffumorphisms
[07:41.92] and uh we can note that
[07:47.20] such a flow phi
[07:52.00] is generated by a vector field
[07:56.84] v okay that's something that i
[08:00.48] discussed previously in earlier lectures
[08:04.80] but now we've got a general group of
[08:07.72] diffiomorphisms
[08:10.00] we are perfectly able to apply
[08:13.68] the action of this group of diffultisms
[08:16.16] to tensorfields
[08:18.96] so we can use
[08:22.64] phi star t right this is the map induced
[08:26.72] on tensor fields
[08:32.96] to define well so what we could define a
[08:36.48] flow intensive field but we can also use
[08:38.72] phi star of t to define
[08:40.08] a derivative type operator
[08:48.72] different or distinct from the
[08:50.64] covariance derivative that we've been
[08:51.92] discussing so far
[08:54.64] and this derivative operator is called
[08:57.60] the lead derivative
[09:07.68] on tenses and the the point about
[09:13.68] this derivative operator is that it's
[09:15.52] with respect to this vector field v
[09:17.28] if you don't have the vector field v
[09:18.48] then you can't make sense of a um
[09:20.40] the derivative and how is it defined
[09:22.72] well uh as
[09:24.00] all good derivatives infinitesimally
[09:27.84] the way it's defined is you you think of
[09:31.20] the
[09:31.60] flow phi star as
[09:34.64] generating a kind of translation
[09:39.04] and then that that translation depends
[09:41.60] on a parameter t
[09:43.12] so you translate a bit in the reverse
[09:45.36] direction
[09:46.16] and then you subtract away the
[09:47.28] untranslated object
[09:49.52] so in particular
[09:53.68] we define the lead derivative of a
[09:55.44] tensor field a1 through decay
[09:57.36] b1 through to bl as the difference of
[10:00.32] two tensors
[10:02.00] one tensor is located that is the
[10:04.64] difference of two tensors
[10:06.72] they both arrive from a tensor field t
[10:10.88] um but
[10:14.16] this tensor here in yellow
[10:19.12] is evaluated
[10:22.24] at the point phi t
[10:25.84] of some point p and
[10:29.60] this one in blue here
[10:38.48] is evaluated
[10:43.12] at p so that way the tensor in yellow
[10:46.88] after being after phi star
[10:50.24] minus dx on it is at the same point
[10:53.76] as the tensor and t in blue
[10:59.52] so you can uh i won't draw too much on
[11:03.12] the mathematical details of
[11:06.48] the lead derivative uh you should as a
[11:09.04] good exercise check that l v
[11:10.80] t is a tensor field
[11:18.40] so um and that you got to check that
[11:21.44] lv obeys the liveness property
[11:31.12] and of course the that is linear
[11:38.72] okay all these properties are vital if
[11:40.88] you want to
[11:42.16] regard l as a kind of derivative
[11:43.76] operator
[11:46.64] so there's a remark we can make at this
[11:48.40] stage before
[11:49.84] progressing and discussing more
[11:51.28] properties of the lead derivative
[11:53.36] it's defined also for scalar functions
[11:59.44] by
[12:00.44] [Music]
[12:02.56] following formula
[12:07.60] namely that the lead derivative applied
[12:10.96] to
[12:11.28] a scalar function is just the vector v
[12:14.08] applied to the scalar function at the
[12:15.52] point p
[12:19.12] now here's a homework
[12:24.96] uh argue
[12:28.96] that the lead derivative v of a vector
[12:31.92] field
[12:32.56] component w a is none other than the
[12:36.24] commutator of v and w the eighth
[12:38.24] component of the commutator of a
[12:39.60] v and w so that's a very important
[12:42.00] homework exercise we're going to build
[12:43.28] on this when we discuss
[12:46.08] the action of the lead derivative on
[12:48.56] more complicated tensor fields
[12:55.36] so now we're going to describe
[12:58.40] we're going to derive an alternative
[12:59.84] formula you know right you know
[13:01.44] i've got a formula now for the lead
[13:02.64] derivative right it's this thing with
[13:03.84] the blue and yellow tenses
[13:05.60] but we it's not so helpful if you want
[13:07.76] to talk about
[13:08.72] the the action of l on composite tensor
[13:11.12] fields
[13:12.24] or you want the specific action uh on a
[13:15.36] specific tensor field in terms of
[13:16.96] objects you can already compute
[13:18.80] it's our goal now so now note that for
[13:21.84] all dual vectors
[13:23.04] mu in the dual vector space vp star
[13:27.60] and all vector vectors vp
[13:32.64] so because of the the action of
[13:36.08] the lead derivative on scalar functions
[13:38.40] we have that when you contract a dual
[13:40.08] vector against the normal vector you get
[13:41.92] well that's a scalar function right
[13:43.52] so the lead derivative of that there's a
[13:45.20] formula for that that's just applying
[13:48.64] v to this contraction
[13:53.44] and we may as well give this thing a
[13:54.80] name star
[14:00.00] but there's also a second way to compute
[14:02.56] uh
[14:05.12] the action of a vector field on a scalar
[14:07.12] function
[14:08.40] and that involves the covariance
[14:09.68] derivative associated to the metric that
[14:11.44] we have implicitly
[14:12.56] lying around here um so this is the
[14:16.08] second formula for the action
[14:17.84] of a vector on a scalar field is true
[14:20.00] not just for the one that we have
[14:21.60] for the metric under um consideration
[14:24.32] it's actually true for all
[14:26.48] covariance derivatives
[14:29.68] which is kind of interesting right um
[14:33.60] now that's one way of computing the lead
[14:35.20] derivative
[14:36.72] of this of the scalar contraction but
[14:38.96] there is another way right and that's
[14:40.48] because
[14:40.88] leibniz property uh allows us
[14:47.60] to compute the lead derivative
[14:52.64] by
[14:56.80] separately applying the lead derivative
[15:00.32] to the dual vector and to w
[15:05.20] so i need to name this second equation
[15:07.12] here that we're going to make use of
[15:10.72] here we go so the leibniz property
[15:12.64] allows us to to compute the lead
[15:14.24] derivative
[15:14.88] first to the dual vector mu then to the
[15:17.04] dual vector to the normal vector w
[15:19.36] so we have that l v of mu a w a
[15:22.64] is none other than w a
[15:26.16] and do l of v on mu a first
[15:30.48] uh plus then do mu of a on l of
[15:33.68] v on w but remember star star
[15:36.80] tells us that that's equal to the eighth
[15:40.16] component of the commutator of
[15:46.80] v and w
[15:51.44] so we've combined two different lines of
[15:53.92] derivation into one
[15:55.36] and that actually determines the action
[15:57.04] of the lead derivative on dual vectors
[16:06.84] explicitly
[16:11.60] firstly apply the vector field v a v to
[16:14.72] the contraction of mu a and w a
[16:30.96] using the leibniz property of the
[16:32.96] covariant derivative so we've got two
[16:34.32] kinds of
[16:36.08] derivative operators here and also
[16:39.12] note that the commutator of v and w the
[16:41.44] eighth component
[16:42.40] also has another expression in terms of
[16:45.20] covariance derivative operators that we
[16:48.84] derived
[17:00.96] so we find
[17:07.76] noting these two formulae
[17:12.88] we find that the action of the
[17:16.80] the derivative on a joule vector mu a
[17:19.92] is given by v b delta b
[17:23.44] on mu a plus mu b
[17:26.56] delta a on vb
[17:31.68] so we love the explicit formula now for
[17:33.84] the action of the lead derivative
[17:35.44] on a dual vector it involves
[17:38.72] the usual derivative operator delta
[17:41.84] now you can repeat this argument do an
[17:43.52] induction um
[17:45.60] by induction that for general
[17:50.32] tensorfield t the lead derivative
[17:54.48] has the following form
[18:12.56] so i'll leave that as an exercise
[18:53.52] and this formula is true for all
[18:55.68] derivative operators delta
[19:21.20] and now we're actually in a position to
[19:24.32] derive the gauge freedom of general of
[19:27.12] linearized general relativity
[19:29.36] so the gauge freedom of general
[19:30.64] relativity is that of divimorphisms
[19:32.88] but that of linearized general
[19:34.16] relativity will turn out to be well
[19:35.84] infinite
[19:37.04] muscle is implementedly close to the
[19:39.04] identity
[19:43.20] so let's actually derive that now so if
[19:45.36] phi lambda
[19:49.44] is a one parameter group of
[19:50.84] diffumorphisms
[20:07.84] then as i argued just before m
[20:10.88] with the tensorflow of the metric and
[20:13.68] all the other
[20:15.12] tensor fields and m
[20:18.32] with the metric phi lambda star
[20:21.76] applied to the metric right you know m
[20:24.40] is the same right we're applying a
[20:25.92] diffumorphism from the manifold to
[20:27.52] itself
[20:30.32] these two pairs represent
[20:34.16] the same
[20:37.68] space time
[20:44.72] so if
[20:48.48] further
[20:53.28] we allow the metric
[21:00.84] g
[21:04.40] to depend smoothly on some parameter
[21:11.28] we'll name this parameter also lambda
[21:24.96] then we can
[21:28.16] ask what perturbations and this is the
[21:30.40] key point
[21:36.24] around the metric
[21:39.44] uh gab 0 lambda equals 0 which just
[21:43.36] equals our original metric gab
[21:46.00] we can ask what kinds of perturbations
[21:47.84] of a metric
[21:49.52] uh look like local diffumorphisms
[21:55.60] so we're going to name these
[21:56.72] perturbations and call it gamma a b
[21:59.76] so the perturbations of a general
[22:02.72] perturbation of a metric
[22:04.72] we'll call gamma a b and you just get
[22:07.68] them by differentiating g
[22:09.76] with respect to lambda and then setting
[22:11.12] lambda equals zero
[22:12.96] we're going to ask what perturbations of
[22:15.68] this form
[22:17.44] are of the form or are actually
[22:22.16] just infinitesimal
[22:26.60] diffumorphisms
[22:37.28] i.e perturbations
[22:42.64] of the form gamma a b
[22:46.48] prime is of the form of d d lambda no
[22:49.84] longer of g
[22:50.40] a b lambda not a general perturbation
[22:54.40] dimension but ones that are
[22:55.68] infinitesimal results of acting
[22:59.12] with our one parameter group of
[23:00.72] diffumorphisms
[23:02.32] around lambda equals zero
[23:07.76] so it's an exercise
[23:10.88] of just writing out the flow
[23:21.44] we see that
[23:28.72] exactly gamma prime is exactly a
[23:32.16] perturbation arising from a morphism
[23:35.44] when gamma a b
[23:36.32] prime equals gamma a b minus lv
[23:39.68] times g a b
[23:45.60] where v right there's a v mentioned here
[23:48.64] and the v is is the vector field
[23:50.88] generating
[24:02.84] phi
[24:05.36] oops florify lambda
[24:18.00] there you go we have now a definitive
[24:19.36] answer uh for what
[24:21.52] perturbation generated by infinitesimal
[24:24.00] different moles looks like and
[24:25.20] hence these perturbations are precisely
[24:28.16] the gauge freedom of linearized general
[24:29.76] relativity we have an answer
[24:31.68] but there's we want a slightly more
[24:33.60] convenient formula for this
[24:35.12] and we can get that by applying
[24:39.28] this formula that we derived earlier
[24:41.68] let's call it triple star maybe
[24:54.32] we can actually get a slightly more
[24:55.52] explicit formula
[24:57.09] [Music]
[24:59.20] for the action of the the derivative of
[25:01.92] the metric gab
[25:05.52] and we get v of c delta c
[25:09.44] g a b plus g c
[25:12.56] b delta a v c plus
[25:15.76] of course the action of
[25:18.96] the lead derivative
[25:22.00] of the covariance derivative on the
[25:23.68] vector field itself
[25:25.52] but if you note here one of these terms
[25:28.88] will vanish because if we use the metric
[25:32.96] if we use the derivative operator
[25:35.04] determined by the metric which we will
[25:37.12] right in general relativity then the
[25:40.16] covariant derivative of the metric is
[25:41.60] zero right it's one of the key
[25:42.72] properties that defines
[25:44.96] the covariant derivative so we're only
[25:47.84] left with two terms
[25:49.60] and we see that
[25:52.80] infinitesimal diffumorphism so this very
[25:56.24] particular form involving the curvature
[25:57.92] derivative
[25:58.72] applied to v so now we can actually
[26:05.12] say what a gauge transformation
[26:10.00] explicitly of linearized
[26:16.32] generate relativity looks like it
[26:19.60] is then a
[26:22.96] transformation of the form where the
[26:26.16] gamma a b gets mapped to gamma a b prime
[26:30.40] which is just equal to gamma a b minus
[26:32.88] delta a
[26:33.92] v b minus delta b v a
[26:42.72] and we can write that slightly more
[26:44.48] compactly
[26:47.36] using bracket notation there it's a
[26:50.16] symmetrized
[26:50.96] application of the derivative operator
[26:58.00] so if
[27:01.52] if this vanishes
[27:11.60] then we've got a particularly special
[27:13.20] form of
[27:14.80] uh infinitesimal gauge transformation
[27:17.28] namely we have an infinitesimal isometry
[27:18.96] right we just mean that the metric
[27:20.24] doesn't change
[27:45.60] and we have a name for such a thing
[27:53.60] and that is va is called
[27:58.32] a killing vector field
[28:07.04] these will turn up in a handful of
[28:08.40] contexts in the future
[28:11.20] and further more this equation which
[28:13.36] i've actually mentioned before
[28:18.88] killing's equation
[28:22.40] is precisely this condition that v
[28:25.28] generates
[28:25.92] an infinitesimal isometry
[28:29.52] now that we've got the precise
[28:32.72] linearized gauge degrees of freedom of
[28:35.04] linearized
[28:37.20] general relativity in hand we're in a
[28:38.96] position to simplify the linearized
[28:41.12] einstein equation
[28:42.24] and substantially simplify it to the
[28:44.24] point where we can
[28:45.60] pretty explicitly solve it without too
[28:48.08] much pain
[28:53.68] so let's return now to our discussion of
[28:57.52] the linearized einstein
[29:02.40] equation and if you recall
[29:06.24] a linearized einstein equation called i
[29:09.68] has the form of gab1 so the linearized
[29:13.36] einstein tensor which is dc dc
[29:17.60] gamma bar a b plus dc
[29:21.36] d b gamma a
[29:25.44] c bar
[29:30.16] minus a half a to b a b d c
[29:33.36] d d gamma c d bar and that's all got to
[29:36.96] equal
[29:37.84] the stress energy tensor
[29:43.04] and the aim now i mean this is a pretty
[29:45.04] complicated i mean it's linear
[29:46.64] right it's linear in gamma a b bar
[29:49.92] so what are we complaining about well
[29:53.36] uh nothing really i mean you could solve
[29:56.32] linear pdes pretty easily
[29:57.84] but you don't want to right you don't
[29:59.12] want to solve a complicated linear pde
[30:01.12] when you can solve a simpler linear pde
[30:02.96] so that's just
[30:04.80] and we can we're in a position where we
[30:06.64] might be able to do this
[30:09.28] because we aim we can use this
[30:11.20] linearized gauge freedom that we have to
[30:12.72] just re
[30:13.36] find a new gauge just do a diffumorphism
[30:15.68] until this equation looks a bit simpler
[30:25.92] so the aim of the game now is to find a
[30:28.08] linearized
[30:29.60] infinitesimal diphymorphism
[30:36.40] which simplifies one
[30:42.16] you know obviously there is one right i
[30:45.52] wouldn't go through all this trouble if
[30:46.56] there wasn't one
[30:53.60] so what are we doing we're looking for a
[30:55.20] vector field
[30:57.04] which generates an infinitesimal
[31:01.12] anamorphism let's call this vector field
[31:03.12] psi a
[31:05.20] such that what is this vector field got
[31:07.20] to do well when we do this gauge
[31:09.04] transformation when we rewrite the
[31:10.72] metric in terms of the new
[31:13.20] slightly perturbed but gauge equivalent
[31:16.56] metric
[31:17.52] we want that the the thingy that we get
[31:19.84] out
[31:21.44] the new metric we know that it's a bit
[31:24.32] it simplifies equation one
[31:31.60] okay that'll be pretty pretty great if
[31:33.12] we could do that
[31:35.92] and how do we do it well
[31:40.32] there's a pretty simple condition
[31:47.76] i mean let's just go back to the
[31:48.88] equation and sort of guess what it might
[31:50.40] be
[31:51.36] a helpful thing to do um you know
[31:54.24] several places
[31:55.44] in this equation you see the combination
[31:57.44] of a
[31:59.20] derivative operator applied to the
[32:00.88] metric like here so there's the
[32:02.32] derivative operator applied to the
[32:03.84] metric
[32:04.64] here the derivative operator is applied
[32:06.24] to the metric again
[32:07.92] so maybe you could arrange for the first
[32:09.84] derivative of the metric to vanish
[32:28.48] and you're going to see in a second how
[32:29.76] this equation actually helps us achieve
[32:31.28] this goal
[32:44.08] so equation two
[32:53.12] then ensures
[32:57.04] that and
[33:08.32] that combination actually vanishes okay
[33:10.56] that's a
[33:12.88] little exercise just go through and
[33:15.36] substitute for gamma bar
[33:19.60] substitute uh this gauge transformed
[33:23.68] gamma a b into the expression for gamma
[33:25.84] by a b and then convince yourself that
[33:27.76] that's the case
[33:32.80] so in this now we've chosen a gauge
[33:36.16] a simpler parametrization of the
[33:39.36] manifold
[33:42.40] and many terms in the linearized
[33:43.92] einstein's equation vanish now
[33:53.84] and it becomes super simple now so
[33:55.60] linearized einstein's equation becomes
[33:57.84] dc dc gamma a b bar equals minus 16
[34:01.92] pi tab
[34:05.12] it's almost as simple as it can be
[34:10.24] this is like a four-dimensional version
[34:12.08] of poisson's equation
[34:21.92] and it's kind of interesting to note
[34:23.60] that the this has uh
[34:32.84] includes
[34:34.00] in the vacuum case where tab equals zero
[34:41.44] this is exactly the field equations for
[34:44.56] a spin
[34:45.36] two field
[35:02.40] it's pretty interesting massless
[35:05.92] and that's why people talk about uh the
[35:08.40] field equations of quantum gravity being
[35:10.24] for a spin to
[35:12.48] graviton field
[35:17.60] all right now we've got this linearized
[35:19.60] einstein equation
[35:20.64] we've massaged it into a form which is
[35:22.32] sufficiently simple that we might be
[35:23.68] able to really go ahead and solve it in
[35:25.04] some special cases
[35:26.48] well now let's go ahead and solve it in
[35:28.48] some special cases
[35:30.00] so we're going to take a look at one
[35:31.28] particular limit this is really a vital
[35:33.12] limit if we're to have any faith
[35:34.96] in general relativity as being an
[35:37.12] extension of
[35:39.52] our known laws of physics applicable in
[35:42.32] the classical non-relativistic domain
[35:44.56] namely we want to check out if general
[35:46.48] relativity is consistent with newtonian
[35:49.12] gravity when gravity is weak and the
[35:52.16] relative motion of sources is much
[35:54.00] smaller than c
[35:58.16] so this is uh
[36:01.92] newtonian limit is the limit where
[36:06.08] one let's say ah
[36:12.56] gravity is weak we don't want super
[36:14.40] strong gravitational fields
[36:15.92] to talk about the newtonian limit
[36:19.28] uh we want relative motion of the
[36:21.84] sources
[36:22.40] being quite small you don't want things
[36:26.32] zooming by neither speed of light or
[36:28.96] orbiting each other
[36:30.16] the orbital velocity that's close to the
[36:33.76] speed of light
[36:37.92] and see uh the material stresses
[36:46.40] have to be pretty small as well
[36:55.44] you know most of the mass energy density
[36:57.60] has to be in the form of mass energy
[36:59.20] density rather than material stress
[37:03.20] you can't have the material made up of
[37:04.72] little particles zooming around at the
[37:06.08] speed near the speed of light
[37:10.96] okay these assumptions
[37:20.96] allow us to do some simplifications
[37:33.68] they not only allow us to
[37:36.88] infer the existence of a global
[37:38.88] coordinates in
[37:40.32] global coordinate system i mean that's
[37:42.48] in
[37:43.36] implicit or explicitly stated at the
[37:45.36] beginning of our discussion of
[37:46.24] linearized einstein's field equations
[37:49.92] but
[37:50.40] the it's they allow us to infer the
[37:52.40] existence of a global inertial
[37:56.24] coordinate system
[38:03.20] of the flat metric such
[38:06.24] that it's all very well to have a global
[38:08.72] initial coordinate system
[38:10.40] but furthermore such that uh
[38:15.60] the stress energy tensor has essentially
[38:17.44] just got the
[38:18.64] time time component
[38:22.48] so all the other 15 components are
[38:30.84] vanishing
[38:41.44] so this tab is the unit
[38:44.56] tangent vector pointing in the time
[38:49.28] direction
[38:54.72] uh so that's an additional assumption
[39:00.16] that these assumptions may allow us to
[39:01.76] make this additional simplification of
[39:03.76] the stress energy tensor
[39:07.20] and what does it mean well
[39:14.40] approximation two means
[39:19.12] that the momentum densities are small
[39:32.00] and the stresses are small
[39:40.84] and uh sources are slowly moving
[39:46.88] well yeah we've already assumed that
[39:49.92] right
[39:50.56] since the sort however what's a
[39:52.40] consequence of that assumption
[40:02.56] since the sources are slowly moving
[40:07.44] what we're going to do is we're going to
[40:08.56] exploit that to look for
[40:11.28] solutions where the metric basically
[40:14.88] doesn't change
[40:26.72] so that's what does that mean that the
[40:28.40] time derivatives
[40:30.64] of gamma a b are
[40:33.84] neglected right so if the sources are
[40:36.32] sufficiently slowly moving
[40:38.24] then we just assume that the
[40:40.08] gravitational field is
[40:41.52] instantaneously responded to the
[40:45.20] to the sources and hence the time
[40:50.84] derivatives uh
[40:52.40] vanishing
[40:58.16] so a whole bunch of coordinates
[41:01.36] uh components sorry
[41:06.24] of the linearized einstein field
[41:08.48] equation will vanish
[41:11.68] so here's the linearized linear field
[41:13.28] equation in the gauge where everything
[41:14.64] is nice and simple
[41:17.20] so gamma bar a b minus 16 pi
[41:20.56] t a b
[41:26.00] so in this new coordinate system
[41:30.16] a whole bunch of components
[41:33.28] will vanish
[41:56.08] a whole bunch of components on the right
[41:57.36] hand side vanish
[42:03.20] the only time the right hand side where
[42:04.88] the stress energy tensor is
[42:06.56] appears is
[42:10.80] in the zero zero component
[42:25.20] and in that case we get
[42:28.48] minus 16 pi rho on the right hand side
[42:37.52] now this i've drawn this delta squared
[42:39.36] here now this
[42:40.56] i guess it's worth flagging this right
[42:47.76] this has got nothing to do with the
[42:49.12] covariance derivative
[42:54.56] this is the usual laplace operator
[43:01.84] your original three-dimensional laplace
[43:05.12] operator
[43:06.56] because the time derivatives are
[43:07.84] vanished the dc dc
[43:10.40] here simplifies to the the plus
[43:14.24] operator right there's no fourth time
[43:16.24] component so that that's pretty
[43:17.92] convenient
[43:20.08] so we're left with solving well a whole
[43:23.12] bunch of independent poisson
[43:24.64] equations some with the source one term
[43:26.72] of the source and 15 without
[43:32.88] so the solution let's just solve it
[43:34.56] right we know to solve poisson's
[43:35.84] equation that's like
[43:37.76] you should be able to do it you sleep by
[43:39.04] now
[43:42.88] so the solution to poisson's equation
[43:45.04] here
[43:48.56] and what we're going to call this
[43:52.84] equation
[43:54.00] just rewrite it rather than introducing
[43:56.16] yet another equation label
[43:57.60] so the solution of this equation well
[44:00.88] under the assumption right that the
[44:02.64] metric vanishes the metric perturbation
[44:04.56] vanishes as we go to infinity
[44:11.28] well that's pretty easy there's not many
[44:13.20] solutions that have that property of
[44:14.40] poisson's equivalent equation
[44:16.80] namely the metric components themselves
[44:18.64] have to vanish it's pretty much the only
[44:20.32] way you can get it to work
[44:28.24] and now we can use this information
[44:33.04] and further solve the final
[44:37.20] poisson equation
[44:50.64] namely we find that we can express the
[44:54.40] solution in the following terms
[45:00.88] so t is this timeline unit vector
[45:04.08] pointing in the time as
[45:05.52] is the unit vector pointing in the time
[45:07.36] direction
[45:08.72] and we've introduced this phi what's phi
[45:10.80] well phi is just
[45:12.32] well a solution to the poisson equation
[45:15.92] so we sort of
[45:34.96] fine okay so we've got this
[45:41.12] solution now to the full linearized
[45:44.64] einstein equations
[45:47.52] so we're done right so this is
[45:51.28] phi here is just the usual gravitational
[45:52.88] potential of newton's theory
[45:56.16] well let's see are we done i mean like
[45:58.08] okay that's very good we've we've solved
[46:02.80] einstein's uh linearized einstein
[46:05.28] equations
[46:06.88] in this particular limit and we've found
[46:08.48] something that looks suspiciously like
[46:09.84] newtonian theory but we haven't actually
[46:11.36] deduced that it's
[46:12.40] newtonian reduced to the newtonian limit
[46:15.44] to do that we need to understand
[46:18.88] the motion of test particles
[46:24.40] you know how do test particles move in
[46:26.72] this this particular geometry
[46:31.84] well according to the the fundamental
[46:34.48] assumption of general relativity we have
[46:36.00] to solve the geodesic equation to get
[46:37.68] that their motion
[46:40.08] the motion of test particles
[46:43.84] and the geodesic equation well that's
[46:46.32] you know
[46:47.12] an equation we've talked about several
[46:48.96] times now in this lecture course
[46:51.12] in this particular context we can write
[46:53.36] it out in terms of
[46:54.64] crystal symbols
[47:00.16] as follows
[47:07.52] so that's the geodesic equation and now
[47:10.08] that we've got the metric we can work
[47:11.44] out gamma
[47:12.24] and we can then thereby write out this
[47:14.24] differential equation and solve it and
[47:15.76] find the motion of test bodies
[47:22.64] and this is with respect to global
[47:24.00] inertial coordinates
[47:34.64] so but we don't have to just tediously
[47:36.72] do all
[47:39.44] hundreds of calculations here we can use
[47:41.44] a lot of simplifications to do this
[47:43.04] calculation quite quickly
[47:44.88] and the first assumption we're going to
[47:46.16] make to simplify our lives is
[47:48.00] that of assuming that the test body
[47:49.84] moves slowly
[47:53.12] with respect to the speed of light
[47:56.48] so that uh the derivative or the
[47:59.12] velocity of our test particle
[48:01.68] is really one zero zero zero right
[48:04.56] that's the simplest assumption we can
[48:06.00] make about our test body
[48:08.56] that it's moving basically not moving at
[48:11.68] all
[48:13.28] and that the the coordinate time
[48:17.04] is equal to the proper time
[48:22.08] or is approximately the same as the
[48:23.60] proper time
[48:27.84] and when we make that assumption we see
[48:29.28] that loads of equations here vanish
[48:31.36] right we don't have to hardly any of the
[48:33.20] components here are going to matter
[48:35.36] for the calculation of the acceleration
[48:39.04] of our test particle
[48:42.96] so the geodesic equation simplifies
[48:46.84] beautifully
[48:53.20] and we only have to deal with these four
[48:54.80] components of the
[48:56.64] crystal symbols
[49:01.04] and you can work out those components
[49:05.76] in terms of gamma
[49:11.92] these four components here are just
[49:14.08] given by a minus a half d
[49:16.32] d x mu gamma naught naught
[49:19.92] um but that simplifies to d phi d x mu
[49:25.36] for the three components that are really
[49:27.12] important to us
[49:30.96] so you know time derivatives are
[49:32.88] neglected here
[49:46.72] and so the motion we've now simplified
[49:49.52] things
[49:49.92] sufficiently to be able to express the
[49:53.44] motion of the test particle
[49:58.64] in terms of the gravitational potential
[50:02.08] or in terms of a quantity that we can
[50:03.68] now interpret as a gravitational
[50:05.12] potential
[50:05.92] it's minus grad phi
[50:13.28] and this a vector is none other than the
[50:15.28] derivative of the position
[50:18.88] twice with respect to t
[50:31.20] so the a the acceleration of the
[50:32.80] particle is defined with respect to the
[50:34.24] global
[50:34.80] inertial coordinate system so we've
[50:37.68] managed to obtain
[50:38.80] exactly the acceleration of a test
[50:41.52] particle with respect to the
[50:42.64] gravitational field
[50:45.60] of a heavenly body in the newtonian
[50:48.56] limit
[50:50.24] however it's worth stressing that the
[50:51.60] interpretation of the solution and
[50:53.04] general relativity
[50:54.72] is is vastly different than in newtonian
[50:57.68] theory
[50:59.28] so you know imagine we have a heavenly
[51:01.60] body like the sun
[51:02.96] well in general relativity it curves
[51:05.20] space time by the mass energy density
[51:08.40] the earth which is in our case the test
[51:10.88] body
[51:12.08] is in free fall and it moves on the
[51:14.48] geodesics of the curve space time
[51:17.36] metric given by the sun which is
[51:20.96] gab which sold
[51:24.08] einstein's field equations and because
[51:26.72] space-time is now curved
[51:28.48] the uh the the geodesic
[51:31.76] motion of the test body actually closes
[51:34.96] and forms an orbit and the final note is
[51:38.88] that the background inertial observers
[51:40.80] which
[51:41.28] define the global inertial coordinate
[51:42.96] system um
[51:44.48] they're the ones in general relativity
[51:46.32] which are undergoing acceleration that's
[51:48.16] in stark contrast to the newtonian
[51:50.96] special relativity type picture that
[51:54.08] one has had previously okay but that's
[51:56.88] it for today for this lecture today
[51:58.88] thank you very much and good bye
