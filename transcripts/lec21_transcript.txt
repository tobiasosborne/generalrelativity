[00:00.08] hello and welcome back to introduction
[00:01.52] to channel relativity in today's lecture
[00:03.92] we will continue our discussion of
[00:06.24] solutions of einstein's field equations
[00:08.16] that for static
[00:09.28] and spherically symmetric space times
[00:12.56] in particular we're going to continue
[00:13.92] our discussion of the schwarzschild
[00:16.08] solution and this time we're looking
[00:19.52] for a solution of einstein's field
[00:21.12] equations that applies to the interiors
[00:24.24] of celestial bodies
[00:33.36] so we're going to look for interior
[00:34.72] solutions of
[00:37.92] celestial bodies which are static
[00:39.12] spherically symmetric
[00:45.20] and what kind of material are these
[00:48.40] celestial bodies going to be seen to be
[00:49.84] made of
[00:52.40] well we're going to be thinking about
[00:53.92] stars here rather than say
[00:59.04] planets
[01:02.72] and for a star you go we're going to
[01:05.44] take
[01:05.76] as our model for a star not a solid but
[01:08.48] a liquid right
[01:09.76] you can imagine a star is a big hot
[01:12.48] boiling liquid
[01:19.52] so we're going to look for spherically
[01:22.48] symmetric
[01:23.20] and static solutions of i transferred
[01:24.72] equations where the metric
[01:26.48] sorry where the stress energy tensor
[01:29.92] takes the following form it takes the
[01:31.52] perfect fluid
[01:38.84] form
[01:44.08] because we imagine that our star is made
[01:45.92] up is just a liquid
[01:50.80] or gas
[01:56.32] and can redistribute itself
[02:01.60] where liquid the liquid comprising the
[02:04.16] celestial object
[02:05.20] can redistribute itself easily
[02:09.44] and so we've got to
[02:13.04] start by making some assumptions in
[02:16.08] order to
[02:17.44] be able to compare the stress energy
[02:20.80] tensor with
[02:22.64] the metric solution that we have already
[02:26.08] derived on general grounds and
[02:31.12] the observation we're going to use is
[02:33.84] that we should
[02:36.24] choose a direction for this u vector
[02:49.44] and since we're talking about a static
[02:50.96] solution here
[02:55.36] we're going to choose that u has got a
[02:57.52] point in the t direction
[03:00.40] and just for convenience sake we put
[03:01.92] minus square root f
[03:06.00] so as a as a vector it's pointing
[03:09.52] in directly in the t direction
[03:13.36] and f here is exactly
[03:17.12] the f that appears in the vacuum metric
[03:29.28] and yeah as as i emphasized earlier the
[03:32.40] the stress energy tends to star is meant
[03:34.88] to model
[03:35.84] stars hence this time for the first time
[03:39.44] ever
[03:40.48] the abbreviation star is possibly the
[03:42.80] most appropriate
[03:43.92] one for that equation
[03:47.12] now we've got the stress energy tensor
[03:50.16] we have the richie tensor from the
[03:52.16] previous lecture
[03:54.40] if a general static stroke spherically
[03:56.32] symmetric solutions by science field
[03:57.68] equation so we just have to equate the
[03:59.04] two
[04:00.64] now there's uh various
[04:03.84] incarnations of i transfield equations
[04:05.44] we're going to use this trace reversed
[04:06.80] form
[04:08.72] no we are not no not today we just apply
[04:15.36] einstein's
[04:19.04] uh field equations in the usual form
[04:22.24] or the originally for this course quoted
[04:25.20] form
[04:27.12] you know gab equals 8 pi tab
[04:36.08] we're going to apply them
[04:40.32] in this way
[04:51.36] and we will obtain three independent
[04:54.00] equations just as we did in the vacuum
[04:55.76] case
[04:57.36] but to interpret these i'm going to be
[04:59.60] talking about a different slightly
[05:00.88] different coordinate system
[05:05.44] so this is an exercise to just
[05:09.60] do the substitutions of these
[05:22.84] equations
[05:31.04] i'll um just move this around so you can
[05:34.24] to make something explicit here
[05:52.80] so you just take the richie tensor that
[05:54.32] we had before the metric tensor that we
[05:55.92] had before
[05:58.32] put it in the appropriate place of
[05:59.84] einstein's field equations
[06:01.84] and then work out the following
[06:03.76] components now i'll define what
[06:05.36] zero zero one one two two mean in a
[06:07.36] second what what particular components
[06:09.36] are being spoken of here
[06:22.96] so we won't use exactly the same
[06:24.56] coordinates to evaluate these components
[06:27.84] as the vacuum coordinate system
[06:33.68] but just a slightly rescaled version of
[06:36.80] it
[06:42.88] and that makes for a slightly more
[06:44.24] compact solution
[06:47.44] okay firstly i'll box up this equation
[06:51.04] here
[06:52.96] these three equations
[06:59.52] and so we've introduced a couple of
[07:02.16] basis co-vectors just to do
[07:05.20] the computation above
[07:10.32] so we've introduced a basis of four
[07:12.96] co-vectors called e naught through three
[07:17.92] one of them you've more or less seen
[07:19.28] before
[07:23.12] so these are these co vectors uh
[07:26.80] make uh orthonormal with respect to the
[07:29.44] metric
[07:47.52] and using these curvatures we introduce
[07:49.52] the following components so
[07:54.88] this is slightly it just rescales things
[07:57.20] and makes things slightly nicer when
[07:58.88] writing out the
[07:59.76] interior solution to use this particular
[08:01.84] basis
[08:09.44] of course we didn't have to introduce
[08:10.88] this we could have just done thinking
[08:12.72] done everything in the components given
[08:14.16] to us by the the spherical
[08:17.36] symmetric uh coordinate system but it
[08:20.16] slightly simplifies things to do it this
[08:21.68] way
[08:23.44] there we go so we've got three
[08:24.56] independent equations just as before
[08:26.88] and the first thing to note is look at
[08:29.20] equation one there right
[08:31.12] uh there's no f at all in there so
[08:34.56] that's uh that can be pretty much just
[08:36.64] solved directly
[08:53.36] and so rewriting equation one gives us
[08:56.72] the following equation which relates
[09:00.40] h and the
[09:04.72] density rho
[09:09.84] and you can just straightaway integrate
[09:11.36] that right
[09:24.00] and that's what you get
[09:29.04] so i've introduced a constant here mr
[09:37.04] which takes the following form it's
[09:38.56] really an integral of the density
[09:44.56] over the whole object
[09:47.68] with an additional constant which comes
[09:49.20] from the integration
[09:51.12] but we want that this solution for a gab
[09:54.72] is smooth
[10:04.88] as r goes to zero so that implies that
[10:08.64] h r has to go to one
[10:14.16] and uh that means that a
[10:17.20] a has to equal zero that's the only way
[10:19.28] for that to work out
[10:25.92] so we've already obtained a relationship
[10:28.72] between
[10:30.00] rho the density and h
[10:41.36] because the slices
[10:45.28] sigma that we used to derive our
[10:47.36] coordinate system
[10:49.60] two lectures ago because they have to be
[10:51.28] space-like
[10:56.88] then necessarily
[11:00.00] necessarily h the coefficient of
[11:03.12] d r squared well that better be positive
[11:07.28] otherwise you change something space
[11:09.04] like the timeline or at least
[11:10.72] not space like and so that that implies
[11:13.36] actually a condition
[11:14.48] on r
[11:22.24] and if rho is zero
[11:29.44] then we can actually continue
[11:37.60] our interior solution
[11:42.08] age onto the vacuum
[11:54.84] solution
[12:03.36] and it is continued in that fashion if
[12:06.96] at the exterior radius of the celestial
[12:09.44] object
[12:12.16] big m is precisely little m evaluated at
[12:15.44] r
[12:22.88] so we found h or we found the
[12:25.68] relationship between h and rho to be
[12:27.28] more precise
[12:29.92] now we all we need is f
[12:35.92] and to make things slightly easier we're
[12:37.52] going to write not
[12:39.52] f as f but we're going to represent f as
[12:41.84] e to the 2
[12:43.04] phi where phi is some unknown
[12:45.12] [Music]
[12:47.20] function that we're solving for and then
[12:49.52] we take a look at equation two
[12:52.24] and we substitute for our now known
[12:54.16] value of h and
[12:55.44] f and we will obtain an equation
[12:59.20] for phi
[13:19.92] and this equation phi relates r
[13:24.00] p rho
[13:27.52] and m
[13:31.60] to phi
[13:50.64] and we're not going to explicitly solve
[13:52.00] this equation here you have to
[13:53.68] assume an equation of state on p
[13:57.12] and rho to get further
[14:01.76] now uh we're not quite done yet we got
[14:04.40] we haven't
[14:05.28] used all our equations but before we do
[14:07.36] that we'll just make a comment to um
[14:09.36] interpret these these these quantities
[14:12.16] so
[14:12.48] in the limit the newtonian limit where
[14:15.44] the
[14:15.76] the pressure is much lower than the mass
[14:18.32] energy
[14:21.12] uh then uh
[14:24.32] and where mr
[14:29.04] it's much much less than r so there
[14:32.32] isn't much mass energy around
[14:37.84] this equation for phi reduces i mean the
[14:40.16] reason we introduce phi is that we want
[14:41.76] to
[14:42.16] identify it with the gravitational
[14:45.20] potential
[14:48.88] so this equation for phi reduces to well
[14:51.52] you know one that should be familiar
[14:56.16] from newtonian theory namely the it's
[14:58.32] essentially saying it's essentially just
[14:59.60] possible equation for the gravitational
[15:01.68] potential so we already knew that
[15:04.80] from our perturbation approach to
[15:08.96] linearized gravity and now we've learnt
[15:12.40] it
[15:12.88] in the context of the schwarzschild
[15:14.32] solution
[15:24.32] now we have one final equation we
[15:25.76] haven't used up all our equations yet
[15:27.68] uh and but we have related
[15:30.80] these unknown functions f and h to
[15:34.64] row and p now the thing about general
[15:37.44] relativity is you don't just
[15:39.44] specify row and p and then you get f and
[15:42.08] h and then that's it
[15:43.04] i mean there's this complex
[15:44.32] interrelationship between this
[15:46.56] the coordinate system the distribution
[15:48.16] of stress energy and the solution to i
[15:50.40] transferred equations and these things
[15:53.04] influence each other in feedback loop
[15:57.68] and we're going to see that in
[16:01.12] when we substitute
[16:04.32] the two equations which we've derived
[16:06.32] into the third
[16:10.32] we'll have to have we come up with a
[16:11.36] consistency or an extra
[16:13.68] extra consistency condition
[16:21.52] this third equation is a bright pain to
[16:23.28] derive
[16:30.48] there's a lot of algebra going on here
[16:36.00] and it relates the derivative of the
[16:38.32] pressure
[16:40.40] the density and also
[16:46.56] the distribution of mass
[16:49.60] energy
[16:55.68] and this is an equation
[16:59.12] that determines hydrostatic equilibrium
[17:01.20] for the object that we're
[17:03.12] under consideration and it has a name
[17:05.12] it's the
[17:06.24] tolman oppenheimer volkov equation
[17:20.88] of hydrostatic equilibrium
[17:32.40] so this equation has to be satisfied in
[17:34.24] addition to the other two
[17:36.32] that determine in a sense
[17:39.52] f and h
[17:44.96] once you've uh gone ahead and
[17:49.36] substituted your pressure-less density
[17:51.92] relationship
[17:54.00] and you've satisfied all these equations
[17:55.60] you'll have the metric
[18:13.60] and the metric will take the following
[18:15.68] form
[18:24.32] it is d s squared is minus e to the two
[18:27.68] phi
[18:28.72] d t squared plus one minus
[18:32.32] two little m r over r minus one
[18:35.84] t r squared plus r squared d big omega
[18:40.84] squared
[18:58.16] and
[19:01.60] little m of r is as i defined it above
[19:11.12] oops
[19:15.12] so this is the general form of a
[19:18.56] solution
[19:19.36] for a spherically symmetric static
[19:23.68] liquid body celestial body
[19:26.96] we could spend a considerable amount of
[19:29.12] time
[19:30.16] discussing the stability of various
[19:32.88] celestial bodies and
[19:34.48] getting into some very fascinating and
[19:36.16] beautiful topics
[19:38.40] and eventually end up at the topics of
[19:40.72] neutron stars and black holes and so on
[19:43.12] we won't pursue that in this course
[19:45.76] although
[19:46.24] this is a wonderful advanced topic that
[19:48.08] you can follow up on
[19:50.56] instead in the remaining part of the
[19:53.04] course we're going to focus on
[19:54.88] some of the key predictions of general
[19:57.12] relativity
[19:58.64] and uh deriving the the form of these
[20:02.64] predictions
[20:04.08] and the the most important predictions
[20:06.56] that we'll focus on
[20:07.76] in the next lecture is the the motions
[20:10.32] of test bodies
[20:11.60] in particular will also focus on the
[20:13.92] motion of light
[20:15.04] in the the presence of static
[20:17.20] spherically symmetric solutions so that
[20:20.48] neatly brings us to the topic of
[20:24.24] geodesics
[20:27.68] of the schwarzschild solution
[20:38.72] uh and we're gonna make our life simple
[20:40.16] we're gonna derive the motion of
[20:42.16] test bodies in the exterior region right
[20:44.72] it doesn't really make sense to follow
[20:46.88] the motion of a test body as it plunges
[20:48.64] into a star
[20:54.64] because you kind of know what's going to
[20:56.00] happen to the test body as it reaches
[20:57.68] the start
[21:02.32] but it is kind of interesting to think
[21:04.40] about a test body
[21:05.68] dropping into a black hole
[21:09.36] but we won't do that here
[21:20.96] so we're going to derive the geodesics
[21:22.56] in this in the following lectures
[21:24.40] for test bodies and also for light rays
[21:26.40] in the exterior region
[21:41.52] and that's where this the radial
[21:44.00] coefficient is bigger than 2m
[21:50.80] now this our life is made a lot easier
[21:53.44] by the fact that the
[21:54.56] scratch short solution is in fact
[21:56.88] rotation rotationally
[21:57.60] invariant so if you think about a
[22:00.72] celestial body and then a test body
[22:04.24] moving to past
[22:08.08] a spherically symmetric test body then
[22:11.20] you can already hope i see that you know
[22:12.80] no matter how
[22:14.48] the test body moves you could exploit
[22:16.80] the symmetries
[22:18.64] of the solution to move the motion of
[22:22.64] the test body onto
[22:24.56] an equatorial plane we'll get to that uh
[22:27.04] but before that there are in fact
[22:28.80] other symmetries that the shroud
[22:31.28] solution possesses
[22:32.64] which greatly simplifies the derivation
[22:35.60] of geodesics
[22:37.12] and in fact there's another one uh not
[22:39.76] related to
[22:40.56] rotation invariance uh that i'd like to
[22:44.08] highlight now and this is true actually
[22:45.68] for any
[22:46.48] uh killing vector field
[22:50.88] so here's a little proposition very very
[22:52.64] easy to prove actually
[22:54.56] so imagine we have a killing vector
[22:57.84] field and we certainly have that in
[22:59.76] our case here
[23:02.80] and suppose you have a geodesic
[23:10.48] uh and since it's a geodesic it has a
[23:12.56] tangent
[23:15.92] ua then there is a constant of the
[23:19.52] motion you can derive
[23:22.72] namely psi a contracted with you a
[23:27.04] is constant
[23:30.16] along the geodesic
[23:34.84] and this is really simple
[23:37.04] really easy to prove we just
[23:40.48] apply the covariant derivative
[23:44.88] to this quantity
[23:51.04] i mean i'll write it all the way around
[24:00.00] and apply the leibniz rule and then
[24:02.64] we'll almost be done
[24:06.96] so note that the quantity in the
[24:08.24] question is is a scalar right
[24:10.56] that psi a contracted with ui is a
[24:12.32] scalar
[24:14.80] well uh let's look at the two terms
[24:16.80] after applying the leibniz rule
[24:18.64] well the first one
[24:21.76] this one's actually zero
[24:25.04] because the the tensor uaub
[24:28.56] contracted against delta b
[24:32.16] x i b uh delta b psi
[24:35.20] delta a psi b that's b right
[24:40.32] delta b psi a i apologize
[24:44.32] that quantity there has got to be zero
[24:46.00] because of killing's equation
[24:58.24] because this is a killing vector
[25:02.00] it obeys this equation here and the
[25:04.96] thing
[25:05.68] u a u b is symmetric and therefore it's
[25:08.40] gonna be zero
[25:11.04] and the second thing is zero because of
[25:12.48] all that's a geodesic that's just the
[25:14.16] geodesic equation
[25:21.52] so we've just learned that the
[25:23.84] derivative
[25:24.64] along the geodesic of xia contracted
[25:27.36] with ua is
[25:28.24] constant zero
[25:36.88] so that symmetry will turn out to be
[25:38.16] quite handy when we are trying to derive
[25:39.84] the geodesics
[25:41.20] or test bodies and light rays for the
[25:43.28] spharzide solution
[25:46.48] another symmetry which i've already
[25:49.04] alluded to
[25:53.76] is parody reflection
[25:57.28] also rotation in variance
[26:02.40] where if you you can send theta to pi
[26:05.04] minus theta
[26:08.88] and that'll be handy because it allows
[26:11.36] us
[26:12.00] to rotate a solution initially in
[26:16.72] uh some non-equatorial plane into the
[26:19.12] equatorial plane
[26:46.48] so if the initial position and tangent
[26:48.96] vector
[26:50.84] lie in the equatorial plane
[27:01.44] theta equals pi over two then so must
[27:04.72] hold you dizzy
[27:21.60] and what that means is that you can just
[27:23.52] take one rotation and move the geodesic
[27:26.08] motion of any test body into the
[27:28.80] equatorial plane
[27:58.64] cool all right that's it
[28:02.56] in terms of a general comment
[28:06.32] about the symmetries of the
[28:07.68] schwarzschild solution what it means
[28:09.60] for geodesics in the coming lectures
[28:13.20] we will derive the form of the geodesic
[28:15.76] and
[28:16.64] the motion of test bodies in the
[28:18.32] presence of the schwarzschild solution
[28:20.64] and then we will discuss and relate this
[28:22.96] to key predict
[28:24.24] predictions of general relativity that
[28:25.92] have been since confirmed
[28:28.48] and then that really will draw us to the
[28:30.96] end and conclusion
[28:32.32] of this course but that's that's it for
[28:35.12] now
[28:35.60] um thank you very much and i'll see you
[28:37.68] next time
[28:38.88] goodbye
